[![Build GitHub Docs On Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new/?repo=github)

This repository contains the documentation website code and Markdown source files for [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com).

GitHub's Docs team works on pre-production content in a private repo that regularly syncs with this public repo.

Use the table of contents icon <img alt="Table of contents icon" src="./contributing/images/table-of-contents.png" width="25" height="25" /> on the top left corner of this document to navigate to a specific section quickly.
