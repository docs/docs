[![Build GitHub Docs On Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new/?repo=github)

This repository contains the documentation website code and Markdown source files for [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com).

GitHub's Docs team works on pre-production content in a private repo that regularly syncs with this public repo.

Use the table of contents icon <img alt="Table of contents icon" src="./contributing/images/table-of-contents.png" width="25" height="25" /> on the top right corner of this document to navigate to a specific section quickly.

For more complex contributions, please open an issue using the most appropriate [issue template](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose) to describe the changes you'd like to see.

If you're looking for a way to contribute, you can scan through our [help wanted board](https://github.com/github/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) to find open issues already approved for work.

### And that's it!

If you're having trouble with your GitHub account, contact [Support](https://support.github.com).
