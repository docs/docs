A file system enables applications to store and retrieve files on storage devices. Files are placed in a hierarchical structure. The file system specifies naming conventions for files and the format for specifying the path to a file in the tree structure.
Each file system consists of one or more drivers and dynamic-link libraries that define the data formats and features of the file system. File systems can exist on many different types of storage devices, including hard disks, jukeboxes, removable optical disks, tape back-up units, and memory cards.
All file systems supported by Windows have the following storage components:
Volumes. A volume is a collection of directories and files.
Directories. A directory is a hierarchical collection of directories and files.
Files. A file is a logical grouping of related data.

Topic	Description
Directory Management
A directory is a hierarchical collection of directories and files. The only constraint on the number of files that can be contained in a single directory is the physical size of the disk on which the directory is located.
Disk Management
A hard disk is a rigid disk inside a computer that stores and provides relatively quick access to large amounts of data. It is the type of storage most often used with Windows. The system also supports removable media.
File Management
A file object provides a representation of a resource (either a physical device or a resource located on a physical device) that can be managed by the I/O system.
Transactional NTFS (TxF)
Transactional NTFS (TxF) allows file operations on an NTFS file system volume to be performed in a transaction.
Volume Management
The highest level of organization in the file system is the volume. A file system resides on a volume.

# REST
## About this directory
* `lib/rest/index.js` is human-editable.
* `lib/rest/static/*.json` are generated by [scripts](../../script/rest/README.md).

## Editable files

* `lib/rest/index.js` consumes the static decorated schema files and exports `categories`, `operations`, and `operationsEnabledForGitHubApps` used by the REST middleware contextualizer.

## Static files

Generated by `script/rest/update-files.js`:

* `lib/rest/static/decorated` - files generated from the dereferenced OpenAPI schema with the Markdown descriptions rendered in HTML
* `lib/rest/static/dereferenced` - **NOTE** These are only generated if you pass the --keep-dereferenced-files option and are not checked into the repository. This option is for debug only.

## Rendering docs

When the server starts, `middleware/contextualizers/rest.js` accesses the data exported from the static decorated JSON files, fetches the data for the current version and requested path, and adds it to the `context` object. The added property is:

* `req.context.currentRestOperations` - all operations with a category matching the current path

Markdown files in `content/rest/reference` use Liquid to loop over these context properties. The Liquid calls HTML files in the `includes` directory to do most of the rendering. Writers can add content to the Markdown files alongside the Liquid.
