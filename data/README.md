______________________________________________________________________________________ |ELECTRONIC POSTMARK - CERTIFICATION OF ELECTRONIC FILING
Taxpayer:
Primary SSN:
Federal Return Submitted:
Federal Return Acceptance Date:
The Intuit Electronic Postmark shows the date and time Intuit received your federal tax return. The Intuit 
Electronic Postmark documents the filing date of your income tax return, and the electronic postmark 
information should be kept on file with your tax return and other tax-related documentation.
There are two important aspects of the Intuit Electronic Postmark:
1. THE INTUIT ELECTRONIC POSTMARK.
The electronic postmark shows the date and time Intuit received the federal return, and is deemed the 
filing date if the date of the electronic postmark is on or before the date prescribed for filing of the 
federal individual income tax return.
TIMELY FILING:
For your federal return to be considered filed on time, your return must be postmarked on or before 
midnight . Intuitâ€™s electronic postmark is issued in the Pacific Time (PT) zone.
If you are not filing in the PT zone, you will need to add or subtract hours from the Intuit Electronic
Postmark time to determine your local postmark time. For example, if you are filing in the Eastern Time
(ET) zone, and you electronically file your return at 9 AM on , your Intuit 
electronic postmark will indicate , 6 AM. If your federal tax return is rejected,
the IRS still considers it filed on time if the electronic postmark is on or before ,
and a corrected return is submitted and accepted before . If your return is 
submitted after , a new time stamp is issued to reflect that your return was
submitted after the IRS deadline, and consequently, is no longer considered to have been filed on time.
If you request an automatic six-month extension, your return must be electronically postmarked by 
midnight . If your federal tax return is rejected, the IRS will still consider
it filed on time if the electronic postmark is on or before , and the 
corrected return is submitted and accepted by
2. THE ACCEPTANCE DATE.
Once the IRS accepts the electronically filed return, the acceptance date will be provided by the Intuit 
Electronic Filing Center. This date is proof that the IRS accepted the electronically filed return.
