Fix issues linking bank accounts
If you have issues when you try to link a bank account with Google Pay, try these steps.

Fix issues linking with Plaid
Your financial institution isn't listed 
If you don‚Äôt find your bank:

Tap Search and enter the name of your bank. 
Check that the name of the bank you entered is an exact match to the bank‚Äôs official name.
 If your bank still isn‚Äôt listed:

Plaid isn‚Äôt integrated with your financial institution.
Plaid can‚Äôt reliably connect to your financial institution right now. Some financial institutions may not let you connect your accounts to third-party apps.
You can link your account manually. 
Your bank decides whether they want to integrate with Plaid. You can contact your bank to request that they set up Plaid.

Your connection failed
The login and password associated with your account may have changed. Verify your account login and password on your financial institution‚Äôs website. Then, go back into Google Pay and reconnect your account. 
Plaid or your financial institution might have technical difficulties. Try again in a few hours. 
Sometimes a financial institution will make changes that impact your ability to access your financial information. If you encounter a consistent issue, such as a slow or lost connection, reach out to your financial institution to let them know.
Google Pay doesn‚Äôt recognize your bank‚Äôs credentials
When you link your account to Plaid, use your financial institution‚Äôs credentials and not your Google Account credentials.

Your account settings are incompatible
To link your account through Plaid, update your bank settings.
If you have your account set up to require a one-time passcode each time you log in, you‚Äôll need to change the settings to only require a one-time passcode for new devices.
Fix issues linking manually
You didn‚Äôt receive a test deposit
It usually takes 2-3 business days to receive a test deposit in your bank statement. The time can vary depending on the bank.

If you don‚Äôt receive a test deposit after 3 business days, check the account number and routing number you entered. You can also remove your bank account and add it again.

What to do after you receive a test deposit
Important: You have 3 attempts to verify the deposit amount. If you enter an incorrect amount, you‚Äôll get an error message.

After the deposit is in your account, you need to verify the bank deposit amount. 

Open the Google Pay app .
At the top right, tap your profile.
To add your bank account, you won't need to complete the payment.
Tap Google Pay balance  and then Transfer out ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.
Enter the amount you want to transfer.
Tap Next.
To add your preferred bank, tap By [date] (No fee).
Next to the account you want to verify, tap Verification needed.
Enter the amount that Google deposited in your account.
Tap Submit.

Google Payment Corp. (‚ÄúGPC‚Äù) and Third Party Providers may be required to provide certain service agreements, disclosures, notices and other communications (collectively ‚ÄúCommunications‚Äù) to you in written form. Pursuant to this Electronic Communications Policy (the ‚ÄúPolicy‚Äù), we will deliver such Communications to you in electronic form. Your agreement to this Policy confirms your ability and consent to receive such Communications electronically, rather than in paper form.

Capitalized terms not defined in this Policy shall be defined as in the Google Payments Terms of Service.

Electronic delivery of communications
You agree and consent to receive electronically all Communications provided to you in connection with your Google Payments Account and your use of the Services, including but not limited to Google Wallet.

Electronic Communications shall be deemed to be received by you upon delivery in the following manner: (a) posting them to your Google Payments account on the Google Payments or Google Wallet website or in an associated mobile application; (b) posting them on or in a website or mobile application associated with Google or the Services; (c) sending them via electronic mail to the email address you used to create your Google and Google Payments Account registrations; or, (d) otherwise communicating them to you via the Services.

It is your responsibility to open and review Communications that we deliver to you through the means described above. We may, but are not obligated to under this Policy, provide you with notice of the availability of a Communication that is delivered in one of the methods described above (for example, by informing you of such Communication through a notification sent to your mobile device).

You should maintain copies of electronic Communications by printing paper copies or saving electronic copies, as applicable.

Hardware and software requirements
In order to access and retain electronic Communications, you will need to maintain or have access to the following computer hardware and software at your own expense:

a computer or mobile device with Internet or mobile connectivity;

a current web browser that includes 128-bit encryption (e.g. Internet Explorer version 6.0 and above, Firefox version 2.0 and above, Chrome version 3.0 and above, or Safari 3.0 and above) with cookies enabled;

the appropriate mobile application, in the case of Communications delivered through such application;
