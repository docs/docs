Notes on non-GAAP financial measures
1. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are
non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definitio n of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP
results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue
from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax
expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis,
see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement
2. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are e ach non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s
common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax
liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common
equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $79.08, $76.91 and $75.24 at September
30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity
3. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense excludes Firmwide legal expense of $524mm, $118mm and $10mm for the three months
ended September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of adjusted managed net
revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance
4. Corporate & Investment Bank (“CIB”) calculates the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans (“ALL/EOP”) excluding the impact of consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits
and trade finance loans, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio
Additional notes
5. Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ("CECL") accounting guidance. Refer to Note 1 – Basis of Presentation on pages 98-99 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2020 for further information
6. Reflects the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board (the “Federal Reserve”) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition provisions that became effective in the
first quarter of 2020. For the periods ended September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $6.4B and $6.5B,
respectively. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 and Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarterly period ended June 30, 2020 for additional information. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85 -92 of the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s capital metrics
7. High-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) represent the average amount of unencumbered liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in the liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”), and excludes excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. Unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity securitiesand fixed income debt securities, include HQLA-eligible securities which
are included as part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. Does not include borrowing capacity at Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”)
and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 55 -59 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2020 for
additional information
8. On September 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve extended its requirement for large banks to suspend net share repurchases through the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. For further information, see page
10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement
9. In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm began reporting a Wholesale Payments business unit within CIB following a realignment of the Firm’s wholesale payments businesses. The Wholesale Payments
business comprises:
• Merchant Services, which was realigned from CCB to CIB
• Treasury Services and Trade Finance in CIB. Trade Finance was previously reported in Lending in CIB
In connection with the alignment of Wholesale Payments, the assets, liabilities and headcount associated with the Merchant Se rvices business were realigned to CIB from CCB, and the revenue and
expenses of the Merchant Services business is reported across CCB, CIB and CB based primarily on client relationships. Prior periods have been revised to reflect this realignment and revised
allocation methodology
10. In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend-based credit card reward costs from marketing expense to be a reduction of card income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period
amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation
11. In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the
current presentation

on fair value option elected liabilities, and included these positions in other sensitivity-based measures. Additionally, effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude
certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence of these
refinements, the average VaR for each of the follow ing reported components w ould have been different by the follow ing amounts: CIB fixed income of $15mm and $(11)mm, CIB Trading
VaR $11mm and $(11)mm and CIB VaR $11mm and $(8)mm for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures
1. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are
non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definitio n of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP
results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue
from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax
expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis,
see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement
2. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are e ach non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s
common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax
liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common
equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $79.08, $76.91 and $75.24 at September
30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity
3. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense excludes Firmwide legal expense of $524mm, $118mm and $10mm for the three months
ended September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of adjusted managed net
revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance
4. Corporate & Investment Bank (“CIB”) calculates the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans (“ALL/EOP”) excluding the impact of consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits
and trade finance loans, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio
Additional notes
5. Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ("CECL") accounting guidance. Refer to Note 1 – Basis of Presentation on pages 98-99 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2020 for further information
6. Reflects the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board (the “Federal Reserve”) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition provisions that became effective in the
first quarter of 2020. For the periods ended September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $6.4B and $6.5B,
respectively. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 and Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarterly period ended June 30, 2020 for additional information. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85 -92 of the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s capital metrics
7. High-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) represent the average amount of unencumbered liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in the liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”), and excludes excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. Unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity securitiesand fixed income debt securities, include HQLA-eligible securities which
are included as part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. Does not include borrowing capacity at Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”)
and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 55 -59 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2020 for
additional information
8. On September 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve extended its requirement for large banks to suspend net share repurchases through the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. For further information, see page
10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement
9. In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm began reporting a Wholesale Payments business unit within CIB following a realignment of the Firm’s wholesale payments businesses. The Wholesale Payments
business comprises:
• Merchant Services, which was realigned from CCB to CIB
• Treasury Services and Trade Finance in CIB. Trade Finance was previously reported in Lending in CIB
In connection with the alignment of Wholesale Payments, the assets, liabilities and headcount associated with the Merchant Se rvices business were realigned to CIB from CCB, and the revenue and
expenses of the Merchant Services business is reported across CCB, CIB and CB based primarily on client relationships. Prior periods have been revised to reflect this realignment and revised
allocation methodology
10. In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend-based credit card reward costs from marketing expense to be a reduction of card income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period
amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation
11. In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the
current presentation

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures
1. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are
non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definitio n of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP
results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue
from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax
expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis,
see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement
2. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are e ach non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s
common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax
liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common
equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $79.08, $76.91 and $75.24 at September
30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity
3. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense excludes Firmwide legal expense of $524mm, $118mm and $10mm for the three months
ended September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of adjusted managed net
revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance
4. Corporate & Investment Bank (“CIB”) calculates the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans (“ALL/EOP”) excluding the impact of consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits
and trade finance loans, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio
Additional notes
5. Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ("CECL") accounting guidance. Refer to Note 1 – Basis of Presentation on pages 98-99 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2020 for further information
6. Reflects the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board (the “Federal Reserve”) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition provisions that became effective in the
first quarter of 2020. For the periods ended September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $6.4B and $6.5B,
respectively. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 and Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarterly period ended June 30, 2020 for additional information. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85 -92 of the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s capital metrics
7. High-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) represent the average amount of unencumbered liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in the liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”), and excludes excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. Unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity securitiesand fixed income debt securities, include HQLA-eligible securities which
are included as part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. Does not include borrowing capacity at Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”)

non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definitio n of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP
results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue
from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax
expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis,
see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement
2. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are e ach non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s
common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax
liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common
equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $79.08, $76.91 and $75.24 at September
30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity
3. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense excludes Firmwide legal expense of $524mm, $118mm and $10mm for the three months
ended September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of adjusted managed net
revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance
4. Corporate & Investment Bank (“CIB”) calculates the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans (“ALL/EOP”) excluding the impact of consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits
and trade finance loans, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio
