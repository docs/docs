You can link directly to a section in a rendered file by hovering over the section heading to expose {% octicon "link" aria-label="the link" %}.

[Headings](#headings) automatically create anchors which have default names created from the text of the heading, with the following rules:

 * Generated identifiers are UTF-8 URI fragments.
    * See [RFC 3986: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax, Section 3.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.5).
 * All ASCII letters are converted to lower-case.
 * Spaces (UTF-8 codepoint `0x20`) are replaced by hyphens (`-`).
 * Leading and trailing whitespace is removed.
 * All other whitespace characters are removed.
 * Paired formatting markup characters are removed, leaving only their contents (e.g., `_italics_` becomes `italics`).
 * Punctuation and other characters not allowed in a URI fragment are removed.
 * Other multi-byte UTF-8 characters which are valid in URI fragments are not modified.
 * Percent Encoding is not performed.
    * See [RFC 3986: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax, Section 2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-2.1) for the definition of Percent Encoding.
 * If more than one heading has content which would result in identical output by these rules, unique names for instances after the first identical name are generated by appending a hyphen and an auto-incrementing integer in the order they appear in the rendered document.

**Examples**

A simple heading and a section link pointing to it:

```markdown
# Sample Section

TEXT

A link to that section: [Link Text](#sample-section).
```

A heading containing invalid characters, UTF-8 characters, two consecutive spaces between the first and second words, and formatting markup:

```markdown
# This'll  be a _Helpful_ Section About the Greek Letter Θ!

TEXT

A link to that section: [Link Text](#thisll--be-a-helpful-section-about-the-greek-letter-Θ).
```

Multiple headings sharing the same text:

```markdown
### This text is the same
...content of the first section...

# This text is the same
...content of the second section...

Link to the first section: [Name](#this-text-is-the-same).

Link to the second section: [Name](#this-text-is-the-same-1).
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Changing the order of sections having headings with the same name will cause their generated identifiers to change, as well, resulting in links to those sections no longer pointing to the same locations they previously pointed to.\
> Use [Custom anchors](#custom-anchors) to create anchors that will not be automatically changed.
