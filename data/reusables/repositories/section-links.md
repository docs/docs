You can link directly to any section that has a heading. To view the automatically generated anchor in a rendered file, hover over the section heading to expose the {% octicon "link" aria-label="the link" %} icon then click the icon to display the anchor in your browser.

If you need to determine the anchor for a heading in a file you are editing, you can use the following rules:

 * Generated identifiers are UTF-8 URI fragments.
    * See [RFC 3986: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax, Section 3.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.5).
 * All ASCII letters are converted to lower-case.
 * Spaces (UTF-8 codepoint `0x20`) are replaced by hyphens (`-`).
 * Leading and trailing whitespace is removed.
 * All other whitespace characters are removed.
 * Paired formatting markup characters are removed, leaving only their contents (for example, `_italics_` becomes `italics`).
 * Punctuation and other characters not allowed in a URI fragment are removed.
 * Other multi-byte UTF-8 characters which are valid in URI fragments are not modified.
 * If the automatically generated anchor for a heading is identical to an earlier anchor in the same document, a unique identifier is generated by appending a hyphen and an auto-incrementing integer.

> [!NOTE]
> If you edit a heading, or if you change the order of headings with "identical" anchors, you will also need to update any links to those headings as the anchors will change.

A simple heading and a section link pointing to it:

```markdown
# Sample Section

TEXT

A link to that section: [Link Text](#sample-section).
```

A heading containing invalid characters, UTF-8 characters, two consecutive spaces between the first and second words, and formatting markup:

```markdown
# This'll  be a _Helpful_ Section About the Greek Letter Θ!

TEXT

A link to that section: [Link Text](#thisll--be-a-helpful-section-about-the-greek-letter-Θ).
```

Multiple headings sharing the same text:

```markdown
### This text is the same
...content of the first section...

# This text is the same
...content of the second section...

Link to the first section: [Name](#this-text-is-the-same).

Link to the second section: [Name](#this-text-is-the-same-1).
```
