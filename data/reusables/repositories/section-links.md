You can link directly to a section in a rendered file by hovering over the section heading to expose {% octicon "link" aria-label="the link" %}.

Headings (`#`, `##`, etc) automatically create anchors which have default names created from the text of the heading, with the following rules:\
 * All ASCII letters are converted to lower-case.
 * Spaces, including consecutive spaces, are replaced by hyphens (`-`).
 * Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed.
 * Punctuation or other characters not allowed in a URI fragment are removed, not URL-encoded.
 * Paired formatting markup characters, even if legal in a URI fragment, are removed, with their contents remaining (e.g., `_italics_` becomes `italics`).
 * Other printable normalized UTF-8 characters which are valid in URI fragments are allowed and are not URL-encoded (e.g., `Θ`).
 * If more than one heading has content which would result in identical output by these rules, unique names for instances after the first identical name are generated by appending a hyphen and an auto-incremmenting integer in the order they appear in the rendered document.

**Examples**

A simple heading and a section link pointing to it:

```markdown
# Sample Section

TEXT

This is how you would link to that section: [Link Text](#sample-section).
```

A heading containing invalid characters, UTF-8 characters, two consecutive spaces between the first and second words, and formatting markup:

```markdown
# This'll  be a _Helpful_ Section About the Greek Letter Θ!

TEXT

This is how you would link to that section: [Link Text](#thisll--be-a-helpful-section-about-the-greek-letter-Θ).
```

Multiple headings sharing the same text:

```markdown
### This text is the same
...content of the first section...

# This text is the same
...content of the second section...

This is how you link to the first section: [Link Text](#this-text-is-the-same).

This is how you link to the second section: [Link Text](#this-text-is-the-same-1).
```

> [!NOTE]
> Changing the order of sections having headings with the same name will cause their generated identifiers to change, as well, resulting in links no longer pointing to the same locations.
