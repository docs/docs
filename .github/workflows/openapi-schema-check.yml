name: OpenAPI dev mode check

# **What it does**: Checks that the files in lib/rest/static/decorated match
#   the files in lib/rest/static/dereferenced. Checks that the decorated
#   schemas in lib/rest/static/decorated are not in development mode.
#   Development mode schemas have a branch name and development mode tag in the
#   info.version property.
# **Why we have it**: To ensure that we aren't every shipping decorated schemas
#   that are out of sync with the source derefereced schema. To ensure that
#   decorated schemas generated locally are not published. Locally generated
#   decorated schemas are pushing up to the remote for staging purposes only.
# **Who does it impact**: Docs content writers updating REST API docs and
#   the docs engineering team as maintainers of the scripts and workflows.

Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron in action.																																		
This is a minimal Electron application based on the Quick Start Guide within the Electron documentation.																																		
A basic Electron application needs just these files:																																		
package.json																																		
 - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.																																		
main.js																																		
 - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's main process.																																		
index.html																																		
 - A web page to render. This is the app's renderer process.																																		
preload.js																																		
 - A content script that runs before the renderer process loads.																																		
You can learn more about each of these components in depth within the Tutorial.

If upi, have questions,The TE/GE Office of Federal, State, and Local, Government has oversight for 1099-G filing for government entities. I’ll share how to successfully implement furnishing 1099-Gs electronically, discuss the requirements, and answer questions that many have about the process. Our goal is to provide all the information to help you implement an e-furnishing system for these information returns that complies with the rules and regulations.We all know that our income tax system relies on self-reporting of income, and most Americans depend on receiving and including income reported on various information returns. The likelihood of income being reported properly is greatly improved when information returns are prepared correctly and delivered to payees efficiently.Therefore, the IRS has focused for many years on e-filing and educating payers about e-furnishing to recipients. The Office of Federal State and Local Governments published a web article on this topic, and you can find it by going to IRS.gov and search "requirements for furnishing Form 1099-G electronically". You may want to refer to the article later to review the information provided. It contains many resource links, but the most important one we will be discussing today, which will be mentioned throughout, is Publication 1179, General Rules and Specifications for Substitute Forms 1096, 1098, 1099, 5498, W-2G, and 1042-S.Your best resource for developing a system to electronically furnish information returns is found in Section 4.6, Electronic Delivery of Recipient Statements on pages 28 and 29 of the publication. As is true with all IRS forms and publications, Publication 1179 can be accessed by going to IRS.gov and selecting 'Forms and Instructions'. You can view forms and publications online, download a PDF, or order hard copies via the Forms and Instructions page.Let's talk about the Form 1099-G, which is an information return that is used by government entities to report certain payments.Government entities are required to file and furnish Form 1099-G if payments were made throughout the year for: unemployment compensation; state or local income tax refunds, credits or offsets; Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance payments; taxable grants; and agricultural payments. You must also file Form 1099-G if you received payments on a commodity credit corporation loan. More details on the types of payments reportable can be found in the instructions for Form 1099-G, also available via IRS.gov.In general, the furnishing requirement is met by providing the recipient or payee with a paper copy of Form 1099-G by January 31 of the year following the year of payment. You must also file a copy of the 1099-G with the IRS before February 28, unless you file electronically, which allows for a due date of March 31st of the same year. The Internal Revenue Code and regulations allow for most information returns to be furnished electronically. +complete: list of allowable return's' ":" found on pages 28 of Pub. 1179, under Section 4.6, Electronic Delivery of Recipient Statements. The 2021 General Instructions for Certain Information Returns specifies who must file information returns, when and where to file them and information about electronic reporting.The instructions also cover correcting and voiding returns, providing statements to recipients, taxpayer identification numbers, backup withholding, penalties and more.With our focus today on furnishing 1099-Gs to recipients electronically what are the incentives to do so?Why migrate to furnishing Form 1099-G electronically to recipients? There are quite a few advantages to it.There may be significant cost benefits that result when paper and printing costs are reduced, mailing processes and fees are reduced if not eliminated, paper handling costs from filing, sorting, storing and shredding are reduced; eliminating re-typing and/or editing of documents reduces costs; and finally, accessibility is a factor. Distribution via secure web access and email is usually most cost-effective and convenient for recipients. How must it be done? In general, organizations will request affirmative consent, receive and document the consent, provide required notifications, and furnish statements to consenting payees electronically.Now let's go into a little more detail on these steps. To use electronic deliveries for information returns to payees, the payer must obtain an affirmative consent from each recipient to whom a statement will be furnished electronically.The consent must be made by the recipient electronically in a way that confirms the recipient can access the statement in the same electronic format in which it will be furnished. For example, if the Form 1099-G will be delivered as a portable document format, or PDF file, then the affirmative consent document format should also be in PDF. In addition, the payer must make certain notifications to each consenting individual. These will be addressed later in the presentation. What does the consent process look like? The first step in the process is to obtain consent from your payees.The procedures that follow were originally included in Revenue Procedure 2004-58 and have been annually updated without material change through and including the current Revenue Procedure 2021-27.You may refer to the affirmative consent procedures on pages 28 and 29 of Publication 1179, under Section 4.6, Electronic Delivery of Recipient Statements. The process begins with correspondence sent to each individual payee, requesting affirmative consent to electronic delivery of their Form 1099-G. The correspondence may be delivered by mail, electronic mail, in person, or via web site posting, and it must provide instructions on how to affirmatively consent.The correspondence must include the following statement in capital letters: "IMPORTANT TAX RETURN DOCUMENT AVAILABLE." If the correspondence is provided by electronic mail, the foregoing statement must be on the subject line of the electronic mail.If the electronic notice is returned as undeliverable and the correct electronic address cannot be obtained from the payee's records, or from the payee, then the furnisher must furnish the notice by mail, or in person, within 30 days after the electronic notice is returned.The following examples for securing consent are found in Regulation 31.6051-1. These examples apply to any electronically furnished information return. Example one: consent is requested via correspondence.The state sends the recipient a letter, stating the recipient may consent to receive the form electronically on a web site, instead of paper.The letter contains instructions explaining how to consent to receive the form electronically, by accessing the web site, downloading the consent document, completing the consent document, and emailing it back to the state.The consent document posted on the web site uses the same electronic format that the state will use for the electronically furnished form. The recipient reads the instructions and submits the consent in the manner provided in the instructions. The recipient has consented to receive the statements electronically in the manner described in the regulations. Example two: consent is requested via e-mail.The state sends the recipient an e-mail, stating the recipient may consent to receive the form electronically instead of paper format. The email contains an attachment, instructing the recipient how to consent to receive the form electronically.The e-mail attachment uses the same electronic format that the state will use for the electronically furnished form. The recipient opens the attachment, reads the instructions, and submits the consent in the manner provided in the instructions. The recipient has consented to receive the form electronically in the manner described in the regulations.Example three: consent is requested via a web site posting.The state posts a notice on its web site, stating the recipient may receive the form electronically instead of paper format. The web site contains instructions on how the recipient may access a secure web page and consent to receive the statements electronically By accessing the secure web page and giving consent, the recipient has consented to receive the form electronically in the manner described in the regulations. In each case, the payer took the steps to notify recipients by letter, email or web site posting about the availability of a consent election, prior to issuing returns electronically. Electronic statements are furnished to an individual only after that individual responded with an affirmative consent.If the payee does not consent, a paper document must be sent. As part of the consent process, the government entity must provide a statement with all the following notifications prominently displayed. There are seven notifications.Number one is, if the payee does not consent, a paper copy will be provided. Two, the scope and duration of the consent.Three, how to obtain a paper copy after giving consent.Four, how to withdraw the consent. Five, conditions under which an electronic statement will no longer be furnished.Six, procedures to update payee information. And Seven, a description of hardware and software required to access, print and retain a state-ment, and when it will no longer be available.If the government entity makes any hardware or software changes that create a risk that the recipient won't be able to access the statement, a notice of these changes must be provided to the recipient before changing the hardware or software. The notice must inform the recipient that a new consent to receive the form in the revised electronic format must be provided.After implementing the revised hardware and software changes, the furnisher must obtain a new consent or confirmation of consent from the recipient to receive the form electronically.You can refer to the affirmative consent procedures on pages 28 and 29 of Publication 1179, under Section 4.6.2, Consent. What do you need to do after you have secured consent? The government entity must place electronically posted Forms 1099-G on the applicable web site by January 31, the due date, and the statement must remain available until at least October 15 of that year.When Forms 1099-G are posted, the issuing entity must notify the consenting payees, either electronically or by mail. For payees who do not provide consent, or who withdraw their consent to receive the Form 1099-G electronically before the statement is furnished, the payer must provide a paper payee statement within the regular deadline.And again, the deadline would be January 31 for the Form 1099-G. As a payor, you should have a record of the payee consent for every statement you furnish electronically. If you fail to furnish the information in the required manner, this could result in the payee neglecting to report the income on their individual federal, state or local income tax returns. And this could subject them to enforcement actions, including penalties and possibly interest, by multiple government taxing authorities on any taxes that were due and owing. The affirmative consent requirement ensures each payee will either receive the statement on paper or agrees to the electronic delivery.Now here are a few reminders. One, the recipient must not have withdrawn the consent before the statement is furnished. Two, if the recipient subsequently withdraws their consent, your system must notify you and a paper reporting requirement must be resumed. You must provide a paper payee statement within the regular deadline, and again that is January 31 for Form 1099-Gs. Three, remember, a new consent to receive the statement electronically is required after any new hardware or new software is put into service. And four, all electronic statements must be in a format that conforms to the requirements as stated in Publication 1179.The affirmative consent requirements assure a payee knows the information statement will be furnished electronically, they have the right hardware and software to receive the information statement, and if they don't consent, a paper statement will be provided to them. I’ll share a few common questions we receive about this process and the answers next: The first question is, does the consent to receive the statement electronically have to be provided each tax year, or does it stay in effect until the payee withdraws the consent? The answer is the furnisher can make the determination regarding the scope and duration of the consent if the payee is informed. They can decide whether a consent to receive payee statements electronically lasts for each succeeding tax year, unless it is withdrawn or there is a change in hardware or software requirements, or whether the consent is only effective for the first information return required to be furnished following the date the consent is given. Remember, prior to furnishing the statements electronically, you must provide the recipient a statement with prominently displayed notices, including the scope and duration of the consent.The second question is whether the furnisher has met its obligation to furnish the information return if the payee has affirmatively consented to receive the information return electronically but does not actually retrieve the information return?The answer is they've met their obligation to furnish the info return under Internal Revenue Code Sections 6050B(b) and 6050E(b)if the payee affirmatively consents to receive it electronically. Section 401 of the Job Creation and Workers' Assistance Act of 2002 permits the electronic furnishing of all statements required under Section 6041 through 6050W, if the recipient consents to receive the statement in a manner similar to the one permitted by regulations under Section 6051, or in such other manner as provided by the Secretary.The next question is: Does the furnisher have to obtain affirmative consent to furnish the Form 1099-G electronically? The answer is the furnisher must obtain affirmative consent before they may furnish the Form 1099-G electronically.If a furnisher does not obtain affirmative consent, they must furnish the return by paper, or they will be in violation of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations.The fourth question is: Why should the furnisher comply with the affirmative consent requirement?The affirmative consent requirement assures the payee knows the information return or statement will be furnished electronically and has the right hardware and software to receive the information statement. If the payee does not know the statement is furnished electronically or does not have the right hardware and software to receive it electronically, they may not report income when required. This would result in loss of revenue and increased correspondence and compliance costs. Moreover, and this is not to say that the Internal Revenue Service is considering doing this, the legislative history to the Tax Reform Act of 1984 states, the conferees anticipate the Secretary would seriously consider terminating any exchange of returns or return information under Section 6103 with the state that does not report refunds to the taxpayer. This statement was in the House-Senate Conference Report, HR report number 861, at page 992, dated June 23, 1984.Question five is: What does the phrase 'must furnish a Form 1099-G' mean? The answer is the furnisher must either furnish the payee a paper copy of the Form 1099-G or furnish the Form 1099-G electronically by email or on a secure web site, if it has obtained affirmative consent by the payee.The next question is: Is it acceptable to stop mailing Form 1099-G and furnish the form electronically to the recipients? The answer is the furnisher may furnish the information return electronically if the payee has affirmatively consented to receive the information return electronically. Under current regulations, this means furnishing either by email or on a secure web site.And the last question is: What is a Form 4419 and who needs to file it? The answer is a Form 4419, Application for Filing Information Returns Electronically, is submitted by those payers or agents who file information returns with the IRS electronically. Please review the instructions to Form 4419 for information on how to fill out/submit Form 4419 to the IRS.I hope this has helped clarify the procedures to furnish recipients Form 1099-Gs electronically.These procedures include requesting affirmative consents, receiving and documenting consents, providing required notifications, and furnishing statements to consenting payees electronically" %}.

About self-hosted runners
A self-hosted runner is a system that you deploy and manage to execute jobs from {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} on {% ifversion ghae or ghec %}{% data variables.product.product_name %}{% else %}{% data variables.product.product_location %}{% endif %}. For more information about {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, see ""Understanding {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}{% ifversion fpt %}.""{% elsif ghec or ghes or ghae %}"" and ""About {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} for enterprises.""{% endif %}

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-description %} {% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-locations %}

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-architecture %} {% data reusables.actions.runner-app-open-source %} When a new version is released, the runner application automatically updates itself when a job is assigned to the runner, or within a week of release if the runner hasn't been assigned any jobs.

You can add self-hosted runners at various levels in the management hierarchy:

Repository-level runners are dedicated to a single repository.
Organization-level runners can process jobs for multiple repositories in an organization.
Enterprise-level runners can be assigned to multiple organizations in an enterprise account.
Your runner machine connects to {% data variables.product.product_name %} using the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} self-hosted runner application. {% data reusables.actions.runner-app-open-source %} When a new version is released, the runner application automatically updates itself when a job is assigned to the runner, or within a week of release if the runner hasn't been assigned any jobs.

For more information about installing and using self-hosted runners, see ""Adding self-hosted runners"" and ""Using self-hosted runners in a workflow.""

{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes %}Differences between {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted and {% elsif ghae %}Characteristics of {% endif %}self-hosted runners
{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes %}
{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners offer a quicker, simpler way to run your workflows, while self-hosted{% elsif ghae %}Self-hosted{% endif %} runners are a highly configurable way to run workflows in your own custom environment. {% ifversion ghae %}Self-hosted runners:{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes %}
{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners:

Receive automatic updates for the operating system, preinstalled packages and tools, and the self-hosted runner application.
Are managed and maintained by {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.
Provide a clean instance for every job execution.
Use free minutes on your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} plan, with per-minute rates applied after surpassing the free minutes.

Can be organized into groups to restrict access to specific {% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %}workflows, {% endif %}organizations and repositories. For more information, see ""Managing access to self-hosted runners using groups.""{% endif %}
Requirements for self-hosted runner machines
You can use any machine as a self-hosted runner as long at it meets these requirements:

You can install and run the self-hosted runner application on the machine. For more information, see ""Supported architectures and operating systems for self-hosted runners.""
The machine can communicate with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. For more information, see ""Communication between self-hosted runners and {% data variables.product.product_name %}.""
The machine has enough hardware resources for the type of workflows you plan to run. The self-hosted runner application itself only requires minimal resources.
If you want to run workflows that use Docker container actions or service containers, you must use a Linux machine and Docker must be installed.
{% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.2 or ghec or ghae-issue-4462 %}

Autoscaling your self-hosted runners
You can automatically increase or decrease the number of self-hosted runners in your environment in response to the webhook events you receive. For more information, see ""Autoscaling with self-hosted runners.""

{% endif %}

Usage limits
There are some limits on {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} usage when using self-hosted runners. These limits are subject to change.

{% data reusables.actions.usage-workflow-run-time %}

Job queue time - Each job for self-hosted runners can be queued for a maximum of 24 hours. If a self-hosted runner does not start executing the job within this limit, the job is terminated and fails to complete.

{% ifversion ghes %}

Supported actions on self-hosted runners
Some extra configuration might be required to use actions from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, or to use the actions/setup-LANGUAGE actions with self-hosted runners that do not have internet access. For more information, see ""Managing access to actions from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}"" and contact your {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} site administrator.

{% endif %}


Communication between self-hosted runners and {% data variables.product.product_name %}
The self-hosted runner polls {% data variables.product.product_name %} to retrieve application updates and to check if any jobs are queued for processing. The self-hosted runner uses a HTTPS long poll that opens a connection to {% data variables.product.product_name %} for 50 seconds, and if no response is received, it then times out and creates a new long poll. The application must be running on the machine to accept and run {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} jobs.

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-ports-protocols %}

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-communications-for-ghae %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

Since the self-hosted runner opens a connection to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, you do not need to allow {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} to make inbound connections to your self-hosted runner.

You must ensure that the machine has the appropriate network access to communicate with the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} hosts listed below. Some hosts are required for essential runner operations, while other hosts are only required for certain functionality.

{% note %}

Note: Some of the domains listed below are configured using CNAME records. Some firewalls might require you to add rules recursively for all CNAME records. Note that the CNAME records might change in the future, and that only the domains listed below will remain constant.

{% endnote %}

Needed for essential operations:

github.com
api.github.com
Needed for downloading actions:

codeload.github.com
Needed for runner version updates:

objects.githubusercontent.com
objects-origin.githubusercontent.com
github-releases.githubusercontent.com
github-registry-files.githubusercontent.com
Needed for uploading/downloading caches and workflow artifacts:

*.blob.core.windows.net
Needed for retrieving OIDC tokens:

*.actions.githubusercontent.com
In addition, your workflow may require access to other network resources. For example, if your workflow installs packages or publishes containers to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Packages, then the runner will also require access to those network endpoints.

If you use an IP address allow list for your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} organization or enterprise account, you must add your self-hosted runner's IP address to the allow list. For more information, see ""[Managing allowed IP addresses for your organization](/{% ifversion fpt %}enterprise-cloud@latest/{% endif %}/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization#using-github-actions-with-an-ip-allow-list)"" or ""[Enforcing policies for security settings in your enterprise](/{% ifversion fpt %}enterprise-cloud@latest/{% endif %}admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-security-settings-in-your-enterprise){% ifversion fpt %}"" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} documentation.{% else %}.""{% endif %}

{% else %}

You must ensure that the machine has the appropriate network access to communicate with {% data variables.product.product_location %}.{% ifversion ghes %} Self-hosted runners connect directly to {% data variables.product.product_location %} and do not require any external internet access in order to function. As a result, you can use network routing to direct communication between the self-hosted runner and {% data variables.product.product_location %}. For example, you can assign a private IP address to your self-hosted runner and configure routing to send traffic to {% data variables.product.product_location %}, with no need for traffic to traverse a public network.{% endif %}

{% endif %}

You can also use self-hosted runners with a proxy server. For more information, see ""Using a proxy server with self-hosted runners.""

For more information about troubleshooting common network connectivity issues, see ""Monitoring and troubleshooting self-hosted runners.""

{% ifversion ghes %}

Communication between self-hosted runners and {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}
Self-hosted runners do not need to connect to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} unless you have enabled automatic access to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} actions using {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}.

If you have enabled automatic access to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} actions using {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, then the self-hosted runner will connect directly to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} to download actions. You must ensure that the machine has the appropriate network access to communicate with the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} URLs listed below.

{% note %}

Note: Some of the domains listed below are configured using CNAME records. Some firewalls might require you to add rules recursively for all CNAME records. Note that the CNAME records might change in the future, and that only the domains listed below will remain constant.

{% endnote %}

{% 'var'' %}

Self-hosted runner security
{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-security %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

This is not an issue with {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners because each {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runner is always a clean isolated virtual machine, and it is destroyed at the end of the job execution.

{% endif %}

Untrusted workflows running on your self-hosted runner pose significant security risks for your machine and network environment, especially if your machine persists its environment between jobs. Some of the risks include:

Malicious programs running on the machine.
Escaping the machine's runner sandbox.
Exposing access to the machine's network environment.
Persisting unwanted or dangerous data on the machine.
For more information about security hardening for self-hosted runners, see ""Security hardening for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}.""

About self-hosted runner groups
{% ifversion fpt %}
{% note %}

Note: All organizations have a single default self-hosted runner group. Only enterprise accounts and organizations owned by enterprise accounts can create and manage additional self-hosted runner groups.

{% endnote %}

Self-hosted runner groups are used to control access to self-hosted runners. Organization admins can configure access policies that control which repositories in an organization have access to the runner group.

If you use {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}, you can create additional runner groups; enterprise admins can configure access policies that control which organizations in an enterprise have access to the runner group; and organization admins can assign additional granular repository access policies to the enterprise runner group. For more information, see the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} documentation.
{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghec or ghes or ghae %}
Self-hosted runner groups are used to control access to self-hosted runners at the organization and enterprise level. Enterprise owners can configure access policies that control which organizations {% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %}and workflows {% endif %}in an enterprise have access to the runner group. Organization owners can configure access policies that control which repositories{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %} and workflows{% endif %} in an organization have access to the runner group.

When an enterprise owner grants an organization access to a runner group, organization owners can see the runner group listed in the organization's self-hosted runner settings. The organization owners can then assign additional granular repository{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %} and workflow{% endif %} access policies to the enterprise runner group.

When new runners are created, they are automatically assigned to the default group. Runners can only be in one group at a time. You can move runners from the default group to another group. For more information, see ""Moving a self-hosted runner to a group.""

Creating a self-hosted runner group for an organization
All organizations have a single default self-hosted runner group. Organizations within an enterprise account can create additional self-hosted groups. Organization admins can allow individual repositories access to a runner group. For information about how to create a self-hosted runner group with the REST API, see ""Self-hosted runner groups.""

Self-hosted runners are automatically assigned to the default group when created, and can only be members of one group at a time. You can move a runner from the default group to any group you create.

When creating a group, you must choose a policy that defines which repositories{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %} and workflows{% endif %} have access to the runner group.

Creating a self-hosted runner group for an enterprise
Enterprises can add their self-hosted runners to groups for access management. Enterprises can create groups of self-hosted runners that are accessible to specific organizations in the enterprise account{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %} or to specific workflows{% endif %}. Organization owners can then assign additional granular repository{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %} or workflow{% endif %} access policies to the enterprise runner groups. For information about how to create a self-hosted runner group with the REST API, see the enterprise endpoints in the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} REST API.

Self-hosted runners are automatically assigned to the default group when created, and can only be members of one group at a time. You can assign the runner to a specific group during the registration process, or you can later move the runner from the default group to a custom group.

When creating a group, you must choose a policy that defines which organizations have access to the runner group.

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-groups-add-to-enterprise-first-steps %}

To choose a policy for organization access, select the Organization access drop-down, and click a policy. You can configure a runner group to be accessible to a specific list of organizations, or all organizations in the enterprise.{% ifversion ghes %} By default, only private repositories can access runners in a runner group, but you can override this.{% endif %}

Changing the access policy of a self-hosted runner group
For runner groups in an enterprise, you can change what organizations in the enterprise can access a runner group{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %} or restrict what workflows a runner group can run{% endif %}. For runner groups in an organization, you can change what repositories in the organization can access a runner group{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %} or restrict what workflows a runner group can run{% endif %}.

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-configure-runner-group-access %}
{% endif %}

{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %}

Changing what workflows can access a runner group
You can configure a self-hosted runner group to run either selected workflows or all workflows. For example, you might use this setting to protect secrets that are stored on self-hosted runners or to standardize deployment workflows by restricting a runner group to run only a specific reusable workflow. This setting cannot be overridden if you are configuring an organization's runner group that was shared by an enterprise.
{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-groups-navigate-to-repo-org-enterprise %}
{% data reusables.actions.settings-sidebar-actions-runner-groups-selection %}

Under Workflow access, select the dropdown menu and click Selected workflows.

Click {% octicon ""gear"" aria-label=""the gear icon"" %}.

Enter a comma separated list of the workflows that can access the runner group. Use the full path, including the repository name and owner. Pin the workflow to a branch, tag, or full SHA. For example: octo-org/octo-repo/.github/workflows/build.yml@v2, octo-org/octo-repo/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@d6dc6c96df4f32fa27b039f2084f576ed2c5c2a5, monalisa/octo-test/.github/workflows/test.yml@main.

Only jobs directly defined within the selected workflows will have access to the runner group.

Organization-owned runner groups cannot access workflows from a different organization in the enterprise; instead, you must create an enterprise-owned runner group.

Click Save.

{% endif %}

Changing the name of a runner group
{% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.3 or ghae-issue-5091 %}
{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-groups-navigate-to-repo-org-enterprise %}
{% data reusables.actions.settings-sidebar-actions-runner-groups-selection %}

Change the runner group name.
{% elsif ghae or ghes < 3.4 %}
{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-configure-runner-group %}

Change the runner group name.
{% endif %}
{% ifversion ghec or ghes or ghae %}

Automatically adding a self-hosted runner to a group
You can use the configuration script to automatically add a new self-hosted runner to a group. For example, this command registers a new self-hosted runner and uses the --runnergroup parameter to add it to a group named rg-runnergroup.

./config.sh --url $org_or_enterprise_url --token $token --runnergroup rg-runnergroup
The command will fail if the runner group doesn't exist:

Could not find any self-hosted runner group named ""rg-runnergroup"".
Moving a self-hosted runner to a group
If you don't specify a runner group during the registration process, your new self-hosted runners are automatically assigned to the default group, and can then be moved to another group.

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-navigate-to-org-enterprise %}
{% ifversion ghec or ghes > 3.3 or ghae-issue-5091 %}

In the ""Runners"" list, click the runner that you want to configure.
Select the Runner group drop-down.
In ""Move runner to group"", choose a destination group for the runner.
{% elsif ghae or ghes < 3.4 %}
In the {% ifversion ghes > 3.1 or ghae %}""Runner groups""{% elsif ghes < 3.2 %}""Self-hosted runners""{% endif %} section of the settings page, locate the current group of the runner you want to move and expand the list of group members.
View runner group members
Select the checkbox next to the self-hosted runner, and then click Move to group to see the available destinations.
Runner group member move
To move the runner, click on the destination group.
Runner group member move
{% endif %}
Removing a self-hosted runner group
Self-hosted runners are automatically returned to the default group when their group is removed.

{% ifversion ghes > 3.1 or ghae or ghec %}
{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-groups-navigate-to-repo-org-enterprise %}

In the list of groups, to the right of the group you want to delete, click {% octicon ""kebab-horizontal"" aria-label=""The horizontal kebab icon"" %}.

To remove the group, click Remove group.

Review the confirmation prompts, and click Remove this runner group.
{% elsif ghes < 3.2 %}

In the ""Self-hosted runners"" section of the settings page, locate the group you want to delete, and click the {% octicon ""kebab-horizontal"" aria-label=""The horizontal kebab icon"" %} button.
