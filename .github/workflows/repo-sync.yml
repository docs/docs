# The docs.github.com project has two repositories: github/docs (public) and github/docs-internal (private)
#
# This GitHub Actions workflow keeps the `main` branch of those two repos in sync.
#
# For more details, see https://github.com/repo-sync/repo-sync#how-it-works

name: Repo Sync

# **What it does**:
#  - close-invalid-repo-sync: Close repo sync pull requests not created by Octomerger or a Hubber.
#  - repo-sync: Syncs docs and docs-internal.
# **Why we have it**:
#  - close-invalid-repo-sync: Another form of spam prevention for the open-source repository.
#  - repo-sync: To keep the open-source repository up-to-date, while still having an internal
#    repository for sensitive work.
# **Who does it impact**: Open-source.

tax withheld from your IRA distribution.
I elect not to have federal income taxes withheld from my distribution(s). I understand that I may be liable for payment of estimated tax. I may incur
penalties under the estimated tax rules, if my withholding and tax payments are not sufficient.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
You may obtain a Medallion Guarantee from a
bank or brokerage firm where you hold an
account. We ask for a guarantee of your
signature instead of a notarization because a
notary does not provide the legal protection
needed to process your transaction. Medallion
Guarantee required if: (1) the distribution is
$50,000 or more, (2) you request a check
distribution to be sent to an address other than
the address of record, (3) you request a check
distribution to be sent to your address of record,
and your address of record has been changed in
the last 15 days, (4) you request an ACH or wire
distribution for bank information not on the
account.
Under penalty of perjury, I certify that (1) the Social Security Number or Taxpayer Identification Number shown on this form is my correct Taxpayer
Identification Number, and (2) I am not subject to backup withholding either because I have not been notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that I
am subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest and dividends, or the IRS has notified me that I am no longer subject to backup
withholding. The IRS does not require your consent to any provision of the document other than the certifications required to avoid backup withholding. If I
am affiliated with or work for a FINRA member firm, I will attach information concerning my employment. This application shall apply to any J.P. Morgan
Funds account I establish at any later date unless specifically changed in writing. Cross off line (2) if you are subject to backup withholding.
The participant hereby authorizes this distribution(s) from the SIMPLE IRA to the undersigned and certifies that it is in accordance with the provisions of the
SIMPLE IRA plan. I indemnify the custodian of J.P. Morgan Funds SIMPLE IRA, its agents, successors and affiliates from any and all claims the undersigned
may have or hereafter claim to have with respect to the distribution(s).

6 Transcript requested. Enter the tax form number here (1040, 1065, 1120, etc.) and check the appropriate box below. Enter only one tax
form number per request. ▶
a Return Transcript, which includes most of the line items of a tax return as filed with the IRS. A tax return transcript does not reflect
changes made to the account after the return is processed. Transcripts are only available for the following returns: Form 1040 series,
Form 1065, Form 1120, Form 1120-A, Form 1120-H, Form 1120-L, and Form 1120S. Return transcripts are available for the current year
and returns processed during the prior 3 processing years. Most requests will be processed within 10 business days . . . . . .
b Account Transcript, which contains information on the financial status of the account, such as payments made on the account, penalty
assessments, and adjustments made by you or the IRS after the return was filed. Return information is limited to items such as tax liability
and estimated tax payments. Account transcripts are available for most returns. Most requests will be processed within 10 business days .
c Record of Account, which provides the most detailed information as it is a combination of the Return Transcript and the Account
Transcript. Available for current year and 3 prior tax years. Most requests will be processed within 10 business days . . . . . .
7 Verification of Nonfiling, which is proof from the IRS that you did not file a return for the year. Current year requests are only available
after June 15th. There are no availability restrictions on prior year requests. Most requests will be processed within 10 business days . .
8 Form W-2, Form 1099 series, Form 1098 series, or Form 5498 series transcript. The IRS can provide a transcript that includes data from
these information returns. State or local information is not included with the Form W-2 information. The IRS may be able to provide this
transcript information for up to 10 years. Information for the current year is generally not available until the year after it is filed with the IRS. For
example, W-2 information for 2016, filed in 2017, will likely not be available from the IRS until 2018. If you need W-2 information for retirement
purposes, you should contact the Social Security Administration at 1-800-772-1213. Most requests will be processed within 10 business days .
Caution: If you need a copy of Form W-2 or Form 1099, you should first contact the payer. To get a copy of the Form W-2 or Form 1099 filed
with your return, you must use Form 4506 and request a copy of your return, which includes all attachments.
9 Year or period requested. Enter the ending date of the year or period, using the mm/dd/yyyy format. If you are requesting more than four
years or periods, you must attach another Form 4506-T. For requests relating to quarterly tax returns, such as Form 941, you must enter
each quarter or tax period separately.
Caution: Do not sign this form unless all applicable lines have been completed.
Signature of taxpayer(s). I declare that I am either the taxpayer whose name is shown on line 1a or 2a, or a person authorized to obtain the tax
information requested. If the request applies to a joint return, at least one spouse must sign. If signed by a corporate officer, 1 percent or more
shareholder, partner, managing member, guardian, tax matters partner, executor, receiver, administrator, trustee, or party other than the taxpayer, I
certify that I have the authority to execute Form 4506-T on behalf of the taxpayer. Note: This form must be received by IRS within 120 days of the
signature date.

legislation enacted after we released it) will be posted on that
page.
The filing location for the Form 4506-T has changed. Please
see Chart for individual transcripts or Chart for all other
transcripts for the correct mailing location.
What’s New. As part of its ongoing efforts to protect
taxpayer data, the Internal Revenue Service announced that
in July 2019, it will stop all third-party mailings of requested
transcripts. After this date masked Tax Transcripts will only
be mailed to the taxpayer’s address of record.
If a third-party is unable to accept a Tax Transcript mailed to
the taxpayer, they may either contract with an existing IVES
participant or become an IVES participant themselves. For
additional information about the IVES program, go to
www.irs.gov and search IVES.
General Instructions
Caution: Do not sign this form unless all applicable lines
have been completed.
Purpose of form. Use Form 4506-T to request tax return
information. Taxpayers using a tax year beginning in one
calendar year and ending in the following year (fiscal tax year)
must file Form 4506-T to request a return transcript.
Note: If you are unsure of which type of transcript you need,
request the Record of Account, as it provides the most
detailed information.
Customer File Number. The transcripts provided by the IRS
have been modified to protect taxpayers' privacy. Transcripts
only display partial personal information, such as the last four
digits of the taxpayer's Social Security Number. Full financial
and tax information, such as wages and taxable income, are
shown on the transcript.
An optional Customer File Number field is available to use
when requesting a transcript. This number will print on the
transcript. See Line 5 instructions for specific requirements.
The customer file number is an optional field and not
required.
Tip. Use Form 4506, Request for Copy of Tax Return, to
request copies of tax returns.
Automated transcript request. You can quickly request
transcripts by using our automated self-help service tools.
Please visit us at IRS.gov and click on “Get a Tax
Transcript...” under “Tools” or call 1-800-908-9946.
Where to file. Mail or fax Form 4506-T to the address below
for the state you lived in, or the state your business was in,
when that return was filed. There are two address charts: one
for individual transcripts (Form 1040 series and Form W-2)
and one for all other transcripts.
If you are requesting more than one transcript or other
product and the chart shows two different addresses, send
your request to the address based on the address of your
most recent return.
Line 1b. Enter your employer identification number (EIN) if
your request relates to a business return. Otherwise, enter the
first social security number (SSN) or your individual taxpayer
identification number (ITIN) shown on the return. For
example, if you are requesting Form 1040 that includes
Schedule C (Form 1040), enter your SSN.
Line 3. Enter your current address. If you use a P.O. box,
include it on this line.
Line 4. Enter the address shown on the last return filed if
different from the address entered on line 3.
Note: If the addresses on lines 3 and 4 are different and you
have not changed your address with the IRS, file Form 8822,
Change of Address. For a business address, file Form 8822-
B, Change of Address or Responsible Party — Business.
Line 5. Enter up to 10 numeric characters to create a unique
customer file number that will appear on the transcript. The
customer file number should not contain an SSN.
Completion of this line is not required.
Note. If you use an SSN, name or combination of both, we
will not input the information and the customer file number
will reflect a generic entry of “9999999999” on the transcript.
Line 6. Enter only one tax form number per request.
Signature and date. Form 4506-T must be signed and dated
by the taxpayer listed on line 1a or 2a. The IRS must receive
Form 4506-T within 120 days of the date signed by the
taxpayer or it will be rejected. Ensure that all applicable lines
are completed before signing.
▲!
CAUTION
You must check the box in the signature area
to acknowledge you have the authority to sign
and request the information. The form will not
be processed and returned to you if the
box is unchecked.
Individuals. Transcripts of jointly filed tax returns may be
furnished to either spouse. Only one signature is required.
Sign Form 4506-T exactly as your name appeared on the
original return. If you changed your name, also sign your
current name.
Corporations. Generally, Form 4506-T can be signed by:
(1) an officer having legal authority to bind the corporation, (2)
any person designated by the board of directors or other
governing body, or (3) any officer or employee on written
request by any principal officer and attested to by the
secretary or other officer. A bona fide shareholder of record
owning 1 percent or more of the outstanding stock of the
corporation may submit a Form 4506-T but must provide
documentation to support the requester's right to receive the
information.
Partnerships. Generally, Form 4506-T can be signed by
any person who was a member of the partnership during any
part of the tax period requested on line 9.
All others. See section 6103(e) if the taxpayer has died, is
insolvent, is a dissolved corporation, or if a trustee, guardian,
executor, receiver, or administrator is acting for the taxpayer.
Note: If you are Heir at law, Next of kin, or Beneficiary you
must be able to establish a material interest in the estate or
trust.
Documentation. For entities other than individuals, you
must attach the authorization document. For example, this
could be the letter from the principal officer authorizing an
employee of the corporation or the letters testamentary
authorizing an individual to act for an estate.
Signature by a representative. A representative can sign
Form 4506-T for a taxpayer only if the taxpayer has
specifically delegated this authority to the representative on
Form 2848, line 5. The representative must attach Form 2848
showing the delegation to Form 4506-T.
Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice. We ask
for the information on this form to establish your right to gain
access to the requested tax information under the Internal
Revenue Code. We need this information to properly identify
the tax information and respond to your request. You are not
required to request any transcript; if you do request a
transcript, sections 6103 and 6109 and their regulations
require you to provide this information, including your SSN or
EIN. If you do not provide this information, we may not be
able to process your request. Providing false or fraudulent
information may subject you to penalties.
Routine uses of this information include giving it to the
Department of Justice for civil and criminal litigation, and
cities, states, the District of Columbia, and U.S.
commonwealths and possessions for use in administering
their tax laws. We may also disclose this information to other
countries under a tax treaty, to federal and state agencies to
enforce federal nontax criminal laws, or to federal law
enforcement and intelligence agencies to combat terrorism.
You are not required to provide the information requested
on a form that is subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act
unless the form displays a valid OMB control number. Books
or records relating to a form or its instructions must be
retained as long as their contents may become material in the
administration of any Internal Revenue law. Generally, tax
returns and return information are confidential, as required by
section 6103.

vary depending on individual circumstances. The estimated
average time is: Learning about the law or the form, 10

Visual Studio Code on Linux

Installation

See the Download Visual Studio Code page for a complete list of available installation options.

By downloading and using Visual Studio Code, you agree to the license terms and privacy statement.

Debian and Ubuntu based distributions

The easiest way to install Visual Studio Code for Debian/Ubuntu based distributions is to download and install the .deb package (64-bit), either through the graphical software center if it's available, or through the command line with:

sudo apt install ./<file>.deb # If you're on an older Linux distribution, you will need to run this instead: # sudo dpkg -i <file>.deb # sudo apt-get install -f # Install dependencies 

Note that other binaries are also available on the VS Code download page.

Installing the .deb package will automatically install the apt repository and signing key to enable auto-updating using the system's package manager. Alternatively, the repository and key can also be installed manually with the following script:

sudo apt-get install wget gpg wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > packages.microsoft.gpg sudo install -D -o root -g root -m 644 packages.microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64,armhf signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list' rm -f packages.microsoft.gpg 

Then update the package cache and install the package using:

sudo apt install apt-transport-https sudo apt update sudo apt install code # or code-insiders 

RHEL, Fedora, and CentOS based distributions

We currently ship the stable 64-bit VS Code in a yum repository, the following script will install the key and repository:

sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[code]\nname=Visual Studio Code\nbaseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/vscode\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc" > /etc/yum.repos.d/vscode.repo' 

Then update the package cache and install the package using dnf (Fedora 22 and above):

dnf check-update sudo dnf install code 

Or on older versions using yum:

yum check-update sudo yum install code 

Due to the manual signing process and the system we use to publish, the yum repo may lag behind and not get the latest version of VS Code immediately.

Snap

Visual Studio Code is officially distributed as a Snap package in the Snap Store:

￼

You can install it by running:

sudo snap install --classic code # or code-insiders 

Once installed, the Snap daemon will take care of automatically updating VS Code in the background. You will get an in-product update notification whenever a new update is available.

Note: If snap isn't available in your Linux distribution, please check the following Installing snapd guide, which can help you get that set up.

Learn more about snaps from the official Snap Documentation.

openSUSE and SLE-based distributions

The yum repository above also works for openSUSE and SLE-based systems, the following script will install the key and repository:

sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[code]\nname=Visual Studio Code\nbaseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/vscode\nenabled=1\ntype=rpm-md\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc" > /etc/zypp/repos.d/vscode.repo' 

Then update the package cache and install the package using:

sudo zypper refresh sudo zypper install code 

AUR package for Arch Linux

There is a community-maintained Arch User Repository package for VS Code.

To get more information about the installation from the AUR, please consult the following wiki entry: Install AUR Packages.

Nix package for NixOS (or any Linux distribution using Nix package manager)

There is a community maintained VS Code Nix package in the nixpkgs repository. In order to install it using Nix, set allowUnfree option to true in your config.nix and execute:

nix-env -i vscode 

Installing .rpm package manually

The VS Code .rpm package (64-bit) can also be manually downloaded and installed, however, auto-updating won't work unless the repository above is installed. Once downloaded it can be installed using your package manager, for example with dnf:

sudo dnf install <file>.rpm 

Note that other binaries are also available on the VS Code download page.

Updates

VS Code ships monthly and you can see when a new release is available by checking the release notes. If the VS Code repository was installed correctly, then your system package manager should handle auto-updating in the same way as other packages on the system.

Note: Updates are automatic and run in the background for the Snap package.

Node.js

Node.js is a popular platform and runtime for easily building and running JavaScript applications. It also includes npm, a Package Manager for Node.js modules. You'll see Node.js and npm mentioned frequently in our documentation and some optional VS Code tooling requires Node.js (for example, the VS Code extension generator).

If you'd like to install Node.js on Linux, see Installing Node.js via package manager to find the Node.js package and installation instructions tailored to your Linux distribution. You can also install and support multiple versions of Node.js by using the Node Version Manager.

To learn more about JavaScript and Node.js, see our Node.js tutorial, where you'll learn about running and debugging Node.js applications with VS Code.

Setting VS Code as the default text editor

xdg-open

You can set the default text editor for text files (text/plain) that is used by xdg-open with the following command:

xdg-mime default code.desktop text/plain 

Debian alternatives system

Debian-based distributions allow setting a default editor using the Debian alternatives system, without concern for the MIME type. You can set this by running the following and selecting code:

sudo update-alternatives --set editor /usr/bin/code 

If Visual Studio Code doesn't show up as an alternative to editor, you need to register it:

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/editor editor $(which code) 10 

Windows as a Linux developer machine

Another option for Linux development with VS Code is to use a Windows machine with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Windows Subsystem for Linux

With WSL, you can install and run Linux distributions on Windows. This enables you to develop and test your source code on Linux while still working locally on a Windows machine. WSL supports Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian, SUSE, and Alpine available from the Microsoft Store.

When coupled with the WSL extension, you get full VS Code editing and debugging support while running in the context of a Linux distro on WSL.

See the Developing in WSL documentation to learn more or try the Working in WSL introductory tutorial.

Common questions

Azure VM Issues

I'm getting a "Running without the SUID sandbox" error?

You can safely ignore this error.

Debian and moving files to trash

If you see an error when deleting files from the VS Code Explorer on the Debian operating system, it might be because the trash implementation that VS Code is using is not there.

Run these commands to solve this issue:

sudo apt-get install gvfs-bin 

Conflicts with VS Code packages from other repositories

Some distributions, for example Pop!_OS provide their own code package. To ensure the official VS Code repository is used, create a file named /etc/apt/preferences.d/code with the following content:

Package: code Pin: origin "packages.microsoft.com" Pin-Priority: 9999 

"Visual Studio Code is unable to watch for file changes in this large workspace" (error ENOSPC)

When you see this notification, it indicates that the VS Code file watcher is running out of handles because the workspace is large and contains many files. Before adjusting platform limits, make sure that potentially large folders, such as Python .venv, are added to the files.watcherExclude setting (more details below). The current limit can be viewed by running:

cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches 

The limit can be increased to its maximum by editing /etc/sysctl.conf (except on Arch Linux, read below) and adding this line to the end of the file:

fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 

The new value can then be loaded in by running sudo sysctl -p.

While 524,288 is the maximum number of files that can be watched, if you're in an environment that is particularly memory constrained, you may want to lower the number. Each file watch takes up 1080 bytes, so assuming that all 524,288 watches are consumed, that results in an upper bound of around 540 MiB.

Arch-based distros (including Manjaro) require you to change a different file; follow these steps instead.

Another option is to exclude specific workspace directories from the VS Code file watcher with the files.watcherExclude setting. The default for files.watcherExclude excludes node_modules and some folders under .git, but you can add other directories that you don't want VS Code to track.

"files.watcherExclude": { "**/.git/objects/**": true, "**/.git/subtree-cache/**": true, "**/node_modules/*/**": true } 

I can't see Chinese characters in Ubuntu

We're working on a fix. In the meantime, open the application menu, then choose File > Preferences > Settings. In the Text Editor > Font section, set "Font Family" to Droid Sans Mono, Droid Sans Fallback. If you'd rather edit the settings.json file directly, set editor.fontFamily as shown:

"editor.fontFamily": "Droid Sans Mono, Droid Sans Fallback" 

Package git is not installed

This error can appear during installation and is typically caused by the package manager's lists being out of date. Try updating them and installing again:

# For .deb sudo apt-get update # For .rpm (Fedora 21 and below) sudo yum check-update # For .rpm (Fedora 22 and above) sudo dnf check-update 

The code bin command does not bring the window to the foreground on Ubuntu

Running code . on Ubuntu when VS Code is already open in the current directory will not bring VS Code into the foreground. This is a feature of the OS which can be disabled using ccsm.

# Install sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager # Run ccsm 

Under General > General Options > Focus & Raise Behaviour, set "Focus Prevention Level" to "Off". Remember this is an OS-level setting that will apply to all applications, not just VS Code.

Cannot install .deb package due to "/etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list: No such file or directory"

This can happen when sources.list.d doesn't exist or you don't have access to create the file. To fix this, try manually creating the folder and an empty vscode.list file:

sudo mkdir /etc/apt/sources.list.d sudo touch /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list 

Cannot move or resize the window while X forwarding a remote window

If you are using X forwarding to use VS Code remotely, you will need to use the native title bar to ensure you can properly manipulate the window. You can switch to using it by setting window.titleBarStyle to native.

Using the custom title bar

The custom title bar and menus were enabled by default on Linux for several months. The custom title bar has been a success on Windows, but the customer response on Linux suggests otherwise. Based on feedback, we have decided to make this setting opt-in on Linux and leave the native title bar as the default.

The custom title bar provides many benefits including great theming support and better accessibility through keyboard navigation and screen readers. Unfortunately, these benefits do not translate as well to the Linux platform. Linux has a variety of desktop environments and window managers that can make the VS Code theming look foreign to users. For users needing the accessibility improvements, we recommend enabling the custom title bar when running in accessibility mode using a screen reader. You can still manually set the title bar with the Window: Title Bar Style (window.titleBarStyle) setting.

Broken cursor in editor with display scaling enabled

Due to an upstream issue #14787 with Electron, the mouse cursor may render incorrectly with scaling enabled. If you notice that the usual text cursor is not being rendered inside the editor as you would expect, try falling back to the native menu bar by configuring the setting window.titleBarStyle to native.

Repository changed its origin value

If you receive an error similar to the following:

E: Repository '...' changed its 'Origin' value from '...' to '...' N: This must be accepted explicitly before updates for this repository can be applied. See apt-secure(8) manpage for details. 

Use apt instead of apt-get and you will be prompted to accept the origin change:

sudo autdeAt update

Deferred Revenues and Remaining Performance Obligations We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Our total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019 was $2.3 billion, of which $1.8 billion was recognized as revenues for the year ending December 31, 2020. Additionally, we have performance obligations associated with commitments in customer contracts, primarily related to Google Cloud, for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues, also referred to as remaining performance obligations. Remaining performance obligations include related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less, (ii) cancellable contracts, and (iii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. As of December 31, 2020, the amount not yet recognized as revenues from these commitments is $29.8 billion.

The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each+case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.+Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and+securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact+related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.+(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing+the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.+(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less+goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a+percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as+investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.+(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at+fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful+assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.+(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the+Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net+yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and+analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are+primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.++QUARTERLY TRENDS FULL YEAR++4Q20 Change 2020 Change+(in millions, except rates) 4Q20 3Q20 2Q20 1Q20 4Q19 3Q20 4Q19 2020 2019 2019+Net interest income - reported $ 13,258 $ 13,013 $ 13,853 $ 14,439 $ 14,166 2 % (6) % $ 54,563 $ 57,245 (5) %+Fully taxable-equivalent adjustments 97 104 107 110 123 (7) (21) 418 531 (21)+Net interest income - managed basis (a) $ 13,355 $ 13,117 $ 13,960 $ 14,549 $ 14,289 2 (7) $ 54,981 $ 57,776 (5)+Less: CIB Markets net interest income 2,166 2,076 2,536 1,596 1,149 4 89 8,374 3,120 168+Net interest income excluding CIB Markets (a) $ 11,189 $ 11,041 $ 11,424 $ 12,953 $ 13,140 1 (15) $ 46,607 $ 54,656 (15)+Average interest-earning assets (b) $ 2,955,646 $ 2,874,974 $ 2,819,689 $ 2,465,549 $ 2,377,544 3 24 $ 2,779,710 $ 2,345,279 19+Less: Average CIB Markets interest-earning assets (b) 743,337 730,141 795,511 735,852 676,566 2 10 751,131 672,417 12+Average interest-earning assets excluding CIB Markets $ 2,212,309 $ 2,144,833 $ 2,024,178 $ 1,729,697 $ 1,700,978 3 30 $ 2,028,579 $ 1,672,862 21+Net yield on average interest-earning assets - managed basis 1.80 % 1.82 % 1.99 % 2.37 % 2.38 % 1.98 % 2.46 %+Net yield on average CIB Markets interest-earning assets 1.16 1.13 1.28 0.87 0.67 1.11 0.46+Net yield on average interest-earning assets excluding CIB Markets 2.01 2.05 2.27 3.01 3.06 2.30 3.27+(a) Interest includes the effect of related hedges.

Additionally, effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence++of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5+million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.+(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA.

The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.+(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.++Page 17++JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.+COMMERCIAL BANKING+FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS+(in millions, except ratio data)++QUARTERLY TRENDS FULL YEAR++4Q20 Change 2020 Change+4Q20 3Q20 2Q20 1Q20 4Q19 3Q20 4Q19 2020 2019 2019++INCOME STATEMENT+REVENUE+Lending- and deposit-related fees (a) $ 325 $ 304 $ 297 $ 261 $ 256 7 % 27 % $ 1,187 $ 941 26 %+All other income (a) 550 457 526 347 436 20 26 1,880 1,769 6+Noninterest revenue 875 761 823 608 692 15 26 3,067 2,710 13+Net interest income 1,588 1,524 1,577 1,557 1,604 4 (1) 6,246 6,554 (5)+TOTAL NET REVENUE (b) 2,463 2,285 2,400 2,165 2,296 8 7 9,313 9,264 1+Provision for credit losses (1,181) (147) 2,431 1,010 110 NM NM 2,113 296 NM+NONINTEREST EXPENSE+Compensation expense 460 492 430 472 444 (7) 4 1,854 1,785 4+Noncompensation expense 490 477 463 514 497 3 (1) 1,944 1,950 —+TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE 950 969 893 986 941 (2) 1 3,798 3,735 2+Income/(loss) before income tax expense/(benefit) 2,694 1,463 (924) 169 1,245 84 116 3,402 5,233 (35)+Income tax expense/(benefit) 660 377 (243) 30 300 75 120 824 1,275 (35)+NET INCOME/(LOSS) $ 2,034 $ 1,086 $ (681) $ 139 $ 945 87 115 $ 2,578 $ 3,958 (35)+Revenue by product+Lending $ 1,177 $ 1,138 $ 1,127 $ 954 $ 1,027 3 15 $ 4,396 $ 4,057 8+Wholesale payments 945 867 925 978 1,020 9 (7) 3,715 4,200 (12)+Investment banking (c) 318 260 256 235 211 22 51 1,069 919 16+Other 23 20 92 (2) 38 15 (39) 133 88 51+Total Commercial Banking net revenue (b) $ 2,463 $ 2,285 $ 2,400 $ 2,165 $ 2,296 8 7 $ 9,313 $ 9,264 1+Investment banking revenue, gross (d) $ 971 $ 840 $ 851 $ 686 $ 634 16 53 $ 3,348 $ 2,744 22+Revenue by client segment+Middle Market Banking $ 947 $ 880 $ 870 $ 943 $ 937 8 1 $ 3,640 $ 3,805 (4)+Corporate Client Banking 856 808 866 673 758 6 13 3,203 3,119 3+Commercial Real Estate Banking 630 576 566 541 537 9 17 2,313 2,169 7+Other 30 21 98 8 64 43 (53) 157 171 (8)+Total Commercial Banking net revenue (b) $ 2,463 $ 2,285 $ 2,400 $ 2,165 $ 2,296 8 7 $ 9,313 $ 9,264 1+FINANCIAL RATIOS+ROE 36 % 19 % (13) % 2 % 16 % 11 % 17 %+Overhead ratio 39 42 37 46 41 41 40+In the fourth quarter of 2020, payment processing-only clients along with the associated revenue and expenses were realigned to CIB’s Wholesale Payments business from CCB and CB.

The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each+case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.+Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and+securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact+related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.+(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing+the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.+(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less+goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a+percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as+investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.+(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at+fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful+assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.+(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the+Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net+yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and+analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are+primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.++QUARTERLY TRENDS FULL YEAR++4Q20 Change 2020 Change+(in millions, except rates) 4Q20 3Q20 2Q20 1Q20 4Q19 3Q20 4Q19 2020 2019 2019+Net interest income - reported $ 13,258 $ 13,013 $ 13,853 $ 14,439 $ 14,166 2 % (6) % $ 54,563 $ 57,245 (5) %+Fully taxable-equivalent adjustments 97 104 107 110 123 (7) (21) 418 531 (21)+Net interest income - managed basis (a) $ 13,355 $ 13,117 $ 13,960 $ 14,549 $ 14,289 2 (7) $ 54,981 $ 57,776 (5)+Less: CIB Markets net interest income 2,166 2,076 2,536 1,596 1,149 4 89 8,374 3,120 168+Net interest income excluding CIB Markets (a) $ 11,189 $ 11,041 $ 11,424 $ 12,953 $ 13,140 1 (15) $ 46,607 $ 54,656 (15)+Average interest-earning assets (b) $ 2,955,646 $ 2,874,974 $ 2,819,689 $ 2,465,549 $ 2,377,544 3 24 $ 2,779,710 $ 2,345,279 19+Less: Average CIB Markets interest-earning assets (b) 743,337 730,141 795,511 735,852 676,566 2 10 751,131 672,417 12+Average interest-earning assets excluding CIB Markets $ 2,212,309 $ 2,144,833 $ 2,024,178 $ 1,729,697 $ 1,700,978 3 30 $ 2,028,579 $ 1,672,862 21+Net yield on average interest-earning assets - managed basis 1.80 % 1.82 % 1.99 % 2.37 % 2.38 % 1.98 % 2.46 %+Net yield on average CIB Markets interest-earning assets 1.16 1.13 1.28 0.87 0.67 1.11 0.46+Net yield on average interest-earning assets excluding CIB Markets 2.01 2.05 2.27 3.01 3.06 2.30 3.27+(a) Interest includes the effect of related hedges.

Additionally, effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence++of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5+million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.+(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA.

The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.+(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.++Page 17++JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.+COMMERCIAL BANKING+FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS+(in millions, except ratio data)++QUARTERLY TRENDS FULL YEAR++4Q20 Change 2020 Change+4Q20 3Q20 2Q20 1Q20 4Q19 3Q20 4Q19 2020 2019 2019++INCOME STATEMENT+REVENUE+Lending- and deposit-related fees (a) $ 325 $ 304 $ 297 $ 261 $ 256 7 % 27 % $ 1,187 $ 941 26 %+All other income (a) 550 457 526 347 436 20 26 1,880 1,769 6+Noninterest revenue 875 761 823 608 692 15 26 3,067 2,710 13+Net interest income 1,588 1,524 1,577 1,557 1,604 4 (1) 6,246 6,554 (5)+TOTAL NET REVENUE (b) 2,463 2,285 2,400 2,165 2,296 8 7 9,313 9,264 1+Provision for credit losses (1,181) (147) 2,431 1,010 110 NM NM 2,113 296 NM+NONINTEREST EXPENSE+Compensation expense 460 492 430 472 444 (7) 4 1,854 1,785 4+Noncompensation expense 490 477 463 514 497 3 (1) 1,944 1,950 —+TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE 950 969 893 986 941 (2) 1 3,798 3,735 2+Income/(loss) before income tax expense/(benefit) 2,694 1,463 (924) 169 1,245 84 116 3,402 5,233 (35)+Income tax expense/(benefit) 660 377 (243) 30 300 75 120 824 1,275 (35)+NET INCOME/(LOSS) $ 2,034 $ 1,086 $ (681) $ 139 $ 945 87 115 $ 2,578 $ 3,958 (35)+Revenue by product+Lending $ 1,177 $ 1,138 $ 1,127 $ 954 $ 1,027 3 15 $ 4,396 $ 4,057 8+Wholesale payments 945 867 925 978 1,020 9 (7) 3,715 4,200 (12)+Investment banking (c) 318 260 256 235 211 22 51 1,069 919 16+Other 23 20 92 (2) 38 15 (39) 133 88 51+Total Commercial Banking net revenue (b) $ 2,463 $ 2,285 $ 2,400 $ 2,165 $ 2,296 8 7 $ 9,313 $ 9,264 1+Investment banking revenue, gross (d) $ 971 $ 840 $ 851 $ 686 $ 634 16 53 $ 3,348 $ 2,744 22+Revenue by client segment+Middle Market Banking $ 947 $ 880 $ 870 $ 943 $ 937 8 1 $ 3,640 $ 3,805 (4)+Corporate Client Banking 856 808 866 673 758 6 13 3,203 3,119 3+Commercial Real Estate Banking 630 576 566 541 537 9 17 2,313 2,169 7+Other 30 21 98 8 64 43 (53) 157 171 (8)+Total Commercial Banking net revenue (b) $ 2,463 $ 2,285 $ 2,400 $ 2,165 $ 2,296 8 7 $ 9,313 $ 9,264 1+FINANCIAL RATIOS+ROE 36 % 19 % (13) % 2 % 16 % 11 % 17 %+Overhead ratio 39 42 37 46 41 41 40+In the fourth quarter of 2020, payment processing-only clients along with the associated revenue and expenses were realigned to CIB’s Wholesale Payments business from CCB and CB.

The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each+case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.+Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and+securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact+related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.+(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing+the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.+(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less+goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a+percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as+investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.+(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at+fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful+assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.+(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the+Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net+yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and+analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are+primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.++QUARTERLY TRENDS FULL YEAR++4Q20 Change 2020 Change+(in millions, except rates) 4Q20 3Q20 2Q20 1Q20 4Q19 3Q20 4Q19 2020 2019 2019+Net interest income - reported $ 13,258 $ 13,013 $ 13,853 $ 14,439 $ 14,166 2 % (6) % $ 54,563 $ 57,245 (5) %+Fully taxable-equivalent adjustments 97 104 107 110 123 (7) (21) 418 531 (21)+Net interest income - managed basis (a) $ 13,355 $ 13,117 $ 13,960 $ 14,549 $ 14,289 2 (7) $ 54,981 $ 57,776 (5)+Less: CIB Markets net interest income 2,166 2,076 2,536 1,596 1,149 4 89 8,374 3,120 168+Net interest income excluding CIB Markets (a) $ 11,189 $ 11,041 $ 11,424 $ 12,953 $ 13,140 1 (15) $ 46,607 $ 54,656 (15)+Average interest-earning assets (b) $ 2,955,646 $ 2,874,974 $ 2,819,689 $ 2,465,549 $ 2,377,544 3 24 $ 2,779,710 $ 2,345,279 19+Less: Average CIB Markets interest-earning assets (b) 743,337 730,141 795,511 735,852 676,566 2 10 751,131 672,417 12+Average interest-earning assets excluding CIB Markets $ 2,212,309 $ 2,144,833 $ 2,024,178 $ 1,729,697 $ 1,700,978 3 30 $ 2,028,579 $ 1,672,862 21+Net yield on average interest-earning assets - managed basis 1.80 % 1.82 % 1.99 % 2.37 % 2.38 % 1.98 % 2.46 %+Net yield on average CIB Markets interest-earning assets 1.16 1.13 1.28 0.87 0.67 1.11 0.46+Net yield on average interest-earning assets excluding CIB Markets 2.01 2.05 2.27 3.01 3.06 2.30 3.27+(a) Interest includes the effect of related hedges.

Additionally, effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence++of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5+million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.+(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA.

The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.+(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.++Page 17++JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.+COMMERCIAL BANKING+FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS+(in millions, except ratio data)++QUARTERLY TRENDS FULL YEAR++4Q20 Change 2020 Change+4Q20 3Q20 2Q20 1Q20 4Q19 3Q20 4Q19 2020 2019 2019++INCOME STATEMENT+REVENUE+Lending- and deposit-related fees (a) $ 325 $ 304 $ 297 $ 261 $ 256 7 % 27 % $ 1,187 $ 941 26 %+All other income (a) 550 457 526 347 436 20 26 1,880 1,769 6+Noninterest revenue 875 761 823 608 692 15 26 3,067 2,710 13+Net interest income 1,588 1,524 1,577 1,557 1,604 4 (1) 6,246 6,554 (5)+TOTAL NET REVENUE (b) 2,463 2,285 2,400 2,165 2,296 8 7 9,313 9,264 1+Provision for credit losses (1,181) (147) 2,431 1,010 110 NM NM 2,113 296 NM+NONINTEREST EXPENSE+Compensation expense 460 492 430 472 444 (7) 4 1,854 1,785 4+Noncompensation expense 490 477 463 514 497 3 (1) 1,944 1,950 —+TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE 950 969 893 986 941 (2) 1 3,798 3,735 2+Income/(loss) before income tax expense/(benefit) 2,694 1,463 (924) 169 1,245 84 116 3,402 5,233 (35)+Income tax expense/(benefit) 660 377 (243) 30 300 75 120 824 1,275 (35)+NET INCOME/(LOSS) $ 2,034 $ 1,086 $ (681) $ 139 $ 945 87 115 $ 2,578 $ 3,958 (35)+Revenue by product+Lending $ 1,177 $ 1,138 $ 1,127 $ 954 $ 1,027 3 15 $ 4,396 $ 4,057 8+Wholesale payments 945 867 925 978 1,020 9 (7) 3,715 4,200 (12)+Investment banking (c) 318 260 256 235 211 22 51 1,069 919 16+Other 23 20 92 (2) 38 15 (39) 133 88 51+Total Commercial Banking net revenue (b) $ 2,463 $ 2,285 $ 2,400 $ 2,165 $ 2,296 8 7 $ 9,313 $ 9,264 1+Investment banking revenue, gross (d) $ 971 $ 840 $ 851 $ 686 $ 634 16 53 $ 3,348 $ 2,744 22+Revenue by client segment+Middle Market Banking $ 947 $ 880 $ 870 $ 943 $ 937 8 1 $ 3,640 $ 3,805 (4)+Corporate Client Banking 856 808 866 673 758 6 13 3,203 3,119 3+Commercial Real Estate Banking 630 576 566 541 537 9 17 2,313 2,169 7+Other 30 21 98 8 64 43 (53) 157 171 (8)+Total Commercial Banking net revenue (b) $ 2,463 $ 2,285 $ 2,400 $ 2,165 $ 2,296 8 7 $ 9,313 $ 9,264 1+FINANCIAL RATIOS+ROE 36 % 19 % (13) % 2 % 16 % 11 % 17 %+Overhead ratio 39 42 37 46 41 41 40+In the fourth quarter of 2020, payment processing-only clients along with the associated revenue and expenses were realigned to CIB’s Wholesale Payments business from CCB and CB.

The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each+case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.+Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and+securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact+related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.+(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing+the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.+(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less+goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a+percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as+investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.+(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at+fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful+assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.+(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the+Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net+yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and+analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are+primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.++QUARTERLY TRENDS FULL YEAR++4Q20 Change 2020 Change+(in millions, except rates) 4Q20 3Q20 2Q20 1Q20 4Q19 3Q20 4Q19 2020 2019 2019+Net interest income - reported $ 13,258 $ 13,013 $ 13,853 $ 14,439 $ 14,166 2 % (6) % $ 54,563 $ 57,245 (5) %+Fully taxable-equivalent adjustments 97 104 107 110 123 (7) (21) 418 531 (21)+Net interest income - managed basis (a) $ 13,355 $ 13,117 $ 13,960 $ 14,549 $ 14,289 2 (7) $ 54,981 $ 57,776 (5)+Less: CIB Markets net interest income 2,166 2,076 2,536 1,596 1,149 4 89 8,374 3,120 168+Net interest income excluding CIB Markets (a) $ 11,189 $ 11,041 $ 11,424 $ 12,953 $ 13,140 1 (15) $ 46,607 $ 54,656 (15)+Average interest-earning assets (b) $ 2,955,646 $ 2,874,974 $ 2,819,689 $ 2,465,549 $ 2,377,544 3 24 $ 2,779,710 $ 2,345,279 19+Less: Average CIB Markets interest-earning assets (b) 743,337 730,141 795,511 735,852 676,566 2 10 751,131 672,417 12+Average interest-earning assets excluding CIB Markets $ 2,212,309 $ 2,144,833 $ 2,024,178 $ 1,729,697 $ 1,700,978 3 30 $ 2,028,579 $ 1,672,862 21+Net yield on average interest-earning assets - managed basis 1.80 % 1.82 % 1.99 % 2.37 % 2.38 % 1.98 % 2.46 %+Net yield on average CIB Markets interest-earning assets 1.16 1.13 1.28 0.87 0.67 1.11 0.46+Net yield on average interest-earning assets excluding CIB Markets 2.01 2.05 2.27 3.01 3.06 2.30 3.27+(a) Interest includes the effect of related hedges.

#1330 proposes to add confirmation to risky commands. It is a nice feature to have, but in order to support proper scriptability, we should support a flag (preferably  -y , like in most CLIs), to skip asking for confirmation. So for each of the 4 commands mentioned there (and possibly even more in the future), we should add support for the  -y  flag
