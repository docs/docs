# The docs.github.com project has two repositories: github/docs (public) and github/docs-internal (private)
#
# This GitHub Actions workflow keeps the `main` branch of those two repos in sync.
#
# For more details, see https://github.com/repo-sync/repo-sync#how-it-works

name: Repo Sync

# **What it does**:
#  - close-invalid-repo-sync: Close repo sync pull requests not created by Octomerger or a Hubber.
#  - repo-sync: Syncs docs and docs-internal.
# **Why we have it**:
#  - close-invalid-repo-sync: Another form of spam prevention for the open-source repository.
#  - repo-sync: To keep the open-source repository up-to-date, while still having an internal
#    repository for sensitive work.
# **Who does it impact**: Open-source.
