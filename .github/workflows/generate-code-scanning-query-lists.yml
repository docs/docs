name: Generate code scanning query lists

# **What it does**: This workflow is currently run manually approximately every two weeks as part
#      of the release process for the CodeQL CLI. We hope to automate this in the future
#   When run, this workflow generates updated query lists with data from the codeql
#   repository, and creates a pull request if there are updates.
# **Why we have it**: So we can automate CodeQL query tables and show code scanning users the built in queries.
# **Who does it impact**: Anyone making CodeQL query suite changes in `github/codeql`, and wanting to get them published on the docs site.
