++| `TRAVIS` | [`GITHUB_ACTIONS`](/actions/reference/environment-variables#default-environment-variables) | Use `GITHUB_ACTIONS` to identify whether tests are being run locally or by {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. Always set to `true` when {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} is running the workflow.|

The firm has implementedshare-repurchase programs consistently. The firm repurchased shares totaling $18.4billion, $31.1 billion, and $50.3 billion in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. In April2021, it authorized another $50 billion for share buybacks. In late 2015, Alphabetbecame a holding company, with Google one of its wholly owned subsidiaries.Alphabet is also the parent company of other businesses, mostly moonshots, whichare grouped into the other bets segment that includes Waymo. This structure hasprovided slightly more transparency to shareholders, as the company‚Äôs mature cash-generating business, Google, is managed separately. In our opinion, such a movemay indicate that management is considering some form of redistribution of cashgenerated by Google to shareholders a few years down the road.Under this structure,Larry Page, who cofounded Google and is a director, was the CEO of parent companyAlphabet. Sergey Brin, the other cofounder of Google and a director of Alphabet, wasthe president of the firm. In December 2019, Page and Brin left their roles (butremained on the board) and Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, also became the CEOof Alphabet. Pichai joined Google in 2004 and was its product chief before becomingCEO in 2015. Susan Wojcicki, who has been with Google since 1999 and convincedGoogle to acquire YouTube, became CEO of YouTube in 2014. Thomas Kurian, formerpresident of Oracle‚Äôs product development group, became the CEO of Google Cloud in2019, a position held by Diane Greene for the previous four years. Ruth Porat is CFOof Alphabet and Google. She was CFO at Morgan Stanley before coming to Alphabetin 2015.Although management‚Äôs decisions have generated exceptional returns forshareholders in the past, and are likely to continue doing so, we remain watchfulregarding the high concentration of voting power. Page, Brin, and former CEO andformer executive chair Eric E. Schmidt still have more than 55% voting power. Inaddition, given Alphabet‚Äôs multiclass share structure, it appears that this highconcentration of power will remain intact in the long run, which could result insignificant conflict of interest if the cofounders and Schmidt, who is no longer withthe firm, make too many high-risk wagers on futuristic projects. However, we havenot seen any indications of this.ProfileAlphabet is a holding company. Internet media giant Google is a wholly ownedsubsidiary. Google generates 99% of Alphabet revenue, of which more than 85% isfrom online ads. Google‚Äôs other revenue is from sales of apps and content on GooglePlay and YouTube, as well as cloud service fees and other licensing revenue. Sales ofhardware such as Chromebooks, the Pixel smartphone, and smart home products,which include Nest and Google Home, also contribute to other revenue. Alphabet‚Äôsmoonshot investments are in its other bets segment, where it bets on technology toenhance health (Verily), faster internet access to homes (Google Fiber), self-drivingcars (Waymo), and more. Alphabet‚Äôs operating margin has been 25%-30%, withGoogle at 30% and other bets operating at a loss.?Page 10 of 12

We continue to be impressed by Berkshire's abilityin most years to generate high-single- to double-digit growth in book value per share,comfortably above our estimate of its cost of capital. We also believe that it will takesome time before the firm finally succumbs to the impediments created by the sheersize and scale of its operations, and that the ultimate departure of Warren Buffettand Charles Munger will have less of an impact on future operating results thanmany investors believe. We view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broadbusiness diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balancesheet strength as true differentiators for the firm. While these advantages have beenovershadowed during much of the past decade by the company's ever expandingcash balances--which have earned next to nothing in near-zero short-term interestrate environments--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it isfocused on reducing its cash hoard through a mixture of stock investments and sharerepurchases. Over the past 12 calendar quarters, the company has repurchased $58billion worth of its common stock, equivalent to $4.8 billion per quarter on average,which eliminated around 10% of the company's total shares outstanding. Thecompany has also pursued higher dividend yielding securities when purchasingequity securities the past several quarters. With the company exiting the first quarterof 2022 with (by our estimates) around $70 billion in dry powder that could be usedto fund acquisitions, stock (and bond) investments, and share repurchases, andvaluations looking more attractive than they have in years for many of the types ofquality assets that Berkshire would prefer to acquire, we expect the firm to remainactive in the near term, although likely to balance its repurchase of its own commonstock with equity investments.Fair Value & Profit DriversWe've decreased our fair value estimate for Berkshire Hathaway to $357 per Class Bshare (from $367) after updating our forecasts for the company's operatingbusinesses and insurance investment portfolio. Our new fair value estimate isequivalent to 1.57, 1.39, and 1.27 times our estimates for Berkshire's book value pershare at the end of 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. For some perspective, duringthe past five (10) years, the shares have traded at an average of 1.40 (1.39) timestrailing calendar quarter-end book value per share. We use a 9.0% cost of equity inour valuation.Our fair value estimate for Berkshire is derived using a sum-of-the-partsmethodology, valuing each of the company's operating segments separately and thenadding them together for the total estimate. As part of this process, we've decreasedour valuation for Berkshire's insurance operations to $159 per Class B share (from$166), owing primarily to the impact that the dislocation in the equity and creditmarkets has had on the investment portfolio in the near term. Our forecast assumesthat Berkshire generates earned premium growth (including the Alleghanyacquisition) of 11.1% on average annually during 2022-26, with a combined ratio forthe insurance operations overall of 99.2% on average annually. We also expect theequity investment portfolio (including market gains/losses and additionalinvestments) to expand at a 4.6% CAGR during our projection period.Our valuation ofBerkshire's railroad operations is $58 per Class B share (down from $59 previously).Our revised forecast assumes carload volumes increase at a 0% to 1% rate annuallyduring 2022-26 (compared with 1%-3% previously), with freight revenue expanding5.0% on average annually and BNSF's operating ratio reaching 60% at the end of2026. Our valuation for the company's utilities and energy division has declined to$30 per Class B share (from $31 previously). This forecast assumes continuedconstructive rate case outcomes, with EBITDA for the firm's regulated U.S. utilitiesexpanding 4%-5% annually on average during 2022-26. As for Berkshire'smanufacturing, service, and retail operations, we've lowered our fair value estimateto $110 per Class B share (from $111 previously). Our new forecast (which includesthe Alleghany acquisition) assumes average annual revenue growth of 3.2% during2022-26 (down from 3.5% previously) and pretax operating margins of 9.1% onaverage annually.Risk & UncertaintyWe are reducing our Morningstar Uncertainty Rating for Berkshire to Low. We don'tconsider any environmental, social, or governance issues at the firm to be materialenough at this point to affect our uncertainty rating, primarily due to the firm's lowerexposure to some of the main ESG risks inherent to the industries where it competes.However, Berkshire has generally scored lower on governance issues because of themakeup of its board and board committees, the unequal voting structure of itsshares, and the lack of engagement and opaqueness historically on governanceissues.Berkshire faces the risk that insurance claims exceed loss reserves or thatmaterial impairments affect its investment portfolio. Several of the firm's keybusinesses--insurance, energy generation and distribution, and rail transport--operate in industries that are subject to higher degrees of regulatory oversight, whichcould affect future business combinations, as well as the setting of rates charged tocustomers. Many of the company's noninsurance operations are exposed to thecyclicality of the economy, with results suffering during economicslowdowns.Berkshire is exposed to foreign currency, equity price, and credit defaultrisk through its various investments and operating companies. Its derivative contractscould affect the firm's earnings and capital position, especially during more volatilemarkets, as they are recorded at fair value and updated periodically to reflect anychanges in value. These contracts started expiring in 2019 and will continue to do sountil 2025.Berkshire depends on two key employees--Warren Buffett and CharlieMunger--for almost all of its investment and capital-allocation decisions. WithBuffett turning 92 in August 2022 and Munger having turned 98 in January 2022, it isincreasingly likely that our valuation horizon will exceed their life spans, with thequality of investment returns and capital allocation being affected.Capital AllocationWarren Buffett has been chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway since 1970.Charlie Munger has served as vice chairman since 1978. Berkshire has two classes ofcommon stock, with Class B shares holding 1/1,500th of the economic rights of ClassA shares and 1/10,000th of the voting rights. Buffett is Berkshire's largestshareholder, with a 30.9% voting stake and a 15.6% economic interest at the end ofJune 2022. Our capital allocation rating for Berkshire is Standard. This rating focuseson the three key areas where we strive to assess management efficacy: balancesheet strength and capital adequacy, investment efficacy, and shareholderdistributions. In our opinion, Berkshire's balance sheet is sound (with the insurer'sliquid investments generally exceeding regulatory benchmarks by more than 2 times),capital investment decisions are fair (with credit for investing in more competitivelyadvantaged businesses and staying disciplined with its underwriting and investmentoptions, offset by a stubbornness about adopting technology to enhance riskassessment and improve operations), and the current capital return strategy is?Page 11 of 12

However, we think the firm has stagnated some the past 5-10 years as annual returns on book value, while exceeding the company's cost ofcapital, have drifted below the returns of the S&P 500 TR Index (which had beenBuffett's preferred benchmark for performance). For much of the past decade,Berkshire has struggled to find enough suitable investments to keep its cashbalances--which were $106.3 billion at the end of March 2022--from expanding, withthe returns on those cash balances being meagre in a historically low-interest-rateenvironment much of the past decade. Meanwhile, several of its larger investments--such as the Kraft Foods merger with Heinz (2014-15), the Precision Castpartsacquisition (2015-16), and taking 10% equity stakes in each of the four major U.S.-based airlines (2016-20)--did not live up to expectations.Even though Buffett hasmore recently discouraged investors from focusing on book value per share growth,we still view it as a valuable gauge for assessing changes in intrinsic value--that is,until such time that Berkshire buys back a ton of its own common stock in a relativelyshort period of time. Absent share repurchases, we would expect the firm to increasebook value per share at a high-single- to low-double-digit rate--comfortably above itscost of capital--in most years. With all of the company's operating businessesmanaged on a decentralized basis, eliminating the need for layers of managementcontrol, and pushing responsibility for each business down to the subsidiary level,Buffett has historically been focused on managing the firm's investments and capital-allocation decisions (basically being a capital allocator in chief). If the firm's nextCEO is expected to do nothing more than act as a caretaker for the business, tendingto the needs of the managers of the different subsidiaries, overseeing the actions ofthe investment managers handling the company's investment portfolio, and dealingwith the capital-allocation and risk assessments that need to be made along theway, then we could not think of a better candidate than Greg Abel, who wasannounced as the heir apparent following this past year's annual meeting.Once thereis a shift in top management, we would expect Berkshire to be more open toinitiating a dividend, as well as potentially accelerating the return of capital toshareholders via share repurchases. Over the past 12 calendar quarters, the companyhas repurchased $58 billion worth of its common stock, equivalent to $4.8 billion perquarter on average.

The firm's core business segment is insurance, run primarilythrough Geico, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, and Berkshire HathawayPrimary Group. Berkshire has used the excess cash thrown off from these and itsother operations over the years to acquire Burlington Northern Santa Fe (railroad),Berkshire Hathaway Energy (utilities and energy distributors), and the firms thatmake up its manufacturing, service, and retailing operations (which include five ofBerkshire's largest noninsurance pretax earnings generators: Precision Castparts,Lubrizol, Clayton Homes, Marmon, and IMC/ISCAR).
