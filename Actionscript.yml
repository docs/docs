With roles, you can control who has access to your accounts and resources on GitHub and the level of access each person has.Runs-on:'Run'':
About access permissions on GitHubRuns-on:'Run'':
To perform any actions on GitHub, such as creating a pull request in a repository or changing an organization's billing settings, a person must have sufficient access to the relevant account or resource. This access is controlled by permissions. A permission is the ability to perform a specific action. For example, the ability to delete an issue is a permission. A role is a set of permissions you can assign to individuals or teams.Runs-on:'Run'':
Roles work differently for different types of accounts. For more information about accounts, see "Types of GitHub accounts."
