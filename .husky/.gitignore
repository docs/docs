Setting up NFC-enabled security key multi-factor authentication (MFA)
Before you start
Set up NFC-Enabled Security Key MFA
Add NFC-enabled security key MFA
Sign in with NFC-Enabled Security Key
NFC-enabled security key multi-factor authentication (MFA) strengthens your ID.me account security by requiring a specialized YubiKey(TM) when you sign in to your ID.me account. 

To use this method, you’ll need a YubiKey(TM) 5 NFC from Yubico, a hardware key that uses Near Field Communications (NFC) technology to wirelessly communicate with supported iOS and Android mobile devices. This article explains how to set up MFA using a YubiKey(TM) and how to sign in after you set it up.

For help with common MFA issues, visit Troubleshooting multi-factor authentication.

Before you start
This method of multi-factor authentication (MFA) is particularly useful with mobile devices.
You will need to connect your YubiKey(TM) hardware with your ID.me Account. 
You can download the free ID.me Authenticator app during MFA setup or beforehand by going to the App Store or Google Play Store.
Set up NFC-Enabled Security Key MFA
To set up an NFC-Enabled Security Key MFA method for the first time:

Select NFC-Enabled Security Key when prompted to choose an MFA method.
MFA-options-Mar20201.png
Select Text message or Email and enter your phone number or email address where you’ll receive an activation link so you can download the ID.me Authenticator app. 
Select Continue. Open the text message or email you receive and select the link.
Follow the prompts to download or activate the ID.me Authenticator app.
If you have previously installed the app, verify your phone number and continue. 
If you haven't installed the app, follow the prompts to install it. 
Open the ID.me Authenticator app from your smartphone and wait for “Ready to Scan” to display. 
Screen_Shot_2019-09-19_at_2.04.24_PM.png
Touch your YubiKey(TM) to your mobile device. The exact location where you touch the key may vary from device to device. 
When the check mark displays, your YubiKey(TM) device has been successfully associated with your ID.me account, and the setup is complete.

Add NFC-enabled security key MFA
If you previously set up a different MFA method, you can add NFC-enabled security key MFA as a secondary MFA method. This won’t replace the first MFA method you set up. To add NFC-enable security key MFA:

Sign in to your ID.me account, using your existing MFA method.
In your account dashboard, select Sign in & Security.
Go to “Push Notification” and select Set up.
When prompted, complete your sign in using your current MFA method.
Select Text me or Call me to choose how you’d like to receive the download link for the ID.me Authenticator app. Enter your phone number or email, then select Continue. 
Select the link in the text message or email you receive.
When the “Ready to scan” pop-up displays on your device, touch your YubiKey(TM) to your mobile device.
In your ID.me account, you’ll see the NFC-enabled security key MFA method was added. 

Sign in with NFC-Enabled Security Key
After you set up your NFC-enabled security key, we’ll prompt you to complete sign in using this method. During the sign in process, you will need to touch the key to your mobile device. To sign in:

Sign in to your ID.me account.
Select NFC-Enabled Mobile Security Key when prompted to choose your MFA method.
Select the notification on your mobile device to open the ID.me Authenticator app.
Wait for the ID.me Authenticator app to display “Ready to Scan,” then touch your YubiKey(TM) to your smartphone.
Screen_Shot_2019-09-19_at_2.02.51_PM.png
A checkmark shows that your sign-in was successful.

-PNC Bank Acquirer Terms
-Last updated: August 22, 2022
-
-These PNC Bank Acquirer Terms (“Member Bank Terms”) are additional terms applicable to the Stripe Payments Services for Visa and Mastercard products for which PNC Bank, N.A. (“Member Bank”) is a Payment Method Acquirer (“VM Payment Processing Services”). In these Member Bank Terms, Visa and Mastercard may be referred to individually as a “Network” and collectively as the “Networks”, and the rules issued by a Network are the “Network Rules.” Additionally, for purposes of these Member Bank Terms, if you are registered with a Network pursuant to applicable Network Rules, you are considered “Network Registered.” Any terms used but not defined in these Member Bank Terms will have the meaning provided in the Stripe Services Agreement (“Agreement”).
-
-These Member Bank Terms constitute a legal agreement among you, Stripe, and Member Bank, a national bank, with offices at 300 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222. The legal agreement is formed by Member Bank’s and Stripe’s offer of these Member Bank Terms to you, your acceptance of these Member Bank Terms, and Member Bank’s and Stripe’s subsequent provision of VM Payment Processing Services to you.
-
-These Member Bank Terms are offered to you, and the legal agreement established by these Member Bank Terms becomes effective as provided below.
-
-For all users of the VM Payment Processing Services, except Network Registered users: These Member Bank Terms become effective only when you process more than $1 million in Transactions on a Network within any twelve-month period. Importantly, the $1 million threshold for effectiveness of these Member Bank Terms is set by each Network, and either Network may change its threshold for effectiveness of these Member Bank Terms at any time with no notice to you. Until you process more than $1 million in Transactions on a Network (or such other processing thresholds as may be established by either Network), these Member Bank Terms are not effective, and you do not have a direct legal agreement with Member Bank with respect to the VM Payment Processing Services.
-For Network Registered users of the VM Payment Processing Services: These Member Bank Terms become effective when you process your first Transaction on a Network.
-You understand and agree that Stripe or Member Bank may enforce any provisions of the Agreement that relate to Stripe or Member Bank’s provision of or your use of the VM Payment Processing Services, and you acknowledge that you are directly responsible to Member Bank under the Agreement for any liability to Member Bank caused by your breach of the Agreement. Stripe or Member Bank may also terminate these Member Bank Terms at any time, which may limit or terminate your ability to use the VM Payment Processing Services. Further, either Network may, at any time for any reason, terminate these Member Bank Terms with respect to Payment Processing Services for its products.
-
-You must accept all of the terms and conditions of these Member Bank Terms to use the VM Payment Processing Services. If you do not accept them, you may not receive VM Payment Processing Services.
-
-1. Network Compliance and Disclosure
-Important Member Bank Disclosures: Member Bank discloses that (i) it is the only entity approved to extend acceptance of Visa and Mastercard products directly to you under these Member Bank Terms; (ii) it must be a principal party to these Member Bank Terms; (iii) it is responsible for educating you on the Network Rules with which you must comply, but this information may be provided to you by Stripe; and (iv) subject to Section 4 of these Member Bank Terms, with respect to Transactions processed through the VM Payment Processing Services, it is responsible for and must provide the Settlement Funds (as defined below) that it receives to Stripe (or Stripe’s designated financial services provider) for Stripe’s distribution to you; and (v) with respect to Transactions processed through the VM Payment Processing Services, Stripe is responsible for all funds that may be held in reserve that are derived from your Settlement Funds.
-
-Your Responsibilities: In addition to any other responsibilities set forth in these Member Bank Terms, you agree that, at all times throughout the term of these Member Bank Terms, you will (i) comply with the PCI Standards in using and maintaining Payment Account Details; (ii) maintain fraud and Dispute rates acceptable under the Network Rules; (iii) review and understand the terms of these Member Bank Terms; (iv) comply with the Network Rules and Laws; and (v) comply with the Agreement.
-
-Stripe is registered as a Payment Facilitator and an Independent Sales Organization (ISO) by Member Bank. You may contact Member Bank by writing to PNC Bank, N.A., 1600 Market Street, 8th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103.
-
-2. Purpose of these Member Bank Terms
-When you process more than $1 million within any twelve-month period in Visa or Mastercard Transactions through a particular Payment Method Acquirer, or, if you are Network Registered, when you process your first Visa or Mastercard Transaction through a particular Payment Method Acquirer, applicable Network Rules require you to enter into a direct contractual relationship with the Payment Method Acquirer. These Member Bank Terms constitute your direct contractual relationship with Member Bank, which is a member of the Networks, and a Payment Method Acquirer for Visa and Mastercard Transactions. In accordance with the requirements of the Network Rules, these Member Bank Terms are offered and effective, and your direct contractual relationship with Member Bank is established, as provided in the introductory paragraphs above.
-
-As a Payment Method Acquirer, Member Bank authorizes you to accept payment from your Customers by Visa and Mastercard credit or debit card (“VM Payment Cards”). However, by using the VM Payment Processing Services and accepting VM Payment Cards, you are not establishing a depository or other account with Member Bank. As between Stripe and Member Bank, Stripe is responsible for underwriting and evaluating your eligibility to receive the VM Payment Processing Services, authorizing charges, settling funds to your User Bank Account(s) as provided in Section 4, and providing the VM Payment Processing Services pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.
-
-Stripe, and not Member Bank, will provide customer service to you to resolve any issues you may have related to your use of the VM Payment Processing Services; however, you may contact Member Bank (using the contact information provided above) in the event you are unable to resolve any matters directly with Stripe. You are solely responsible for providing support to your Customers for all issues related to your products and services.
-
-3. Compliance with Visa and Mastercard Rules
-When you use the VM Payment Processing Services to accept charges from VM Payment Cards, you must comply with the Network Rules, including the acceptance guidelines, monitoring programs, and activity reporting (including excessive credits, Disputes, or deposits) set forth therein. Under the Network Rules, certain activity may subject you to Disputes, fees, fines, settlement delays, withholdings, audits of your processing activity, or termination of these Member Bank Terms and/or the Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, you specifically agree to:
-
-i. Only submit Transactions authorized by the cardholder;
-
-ii. Only accept payment for the sale of products or services, and receipt of bona fide donations, conducted by you pursuant to your business as indicated in your Stripe Account and not for any products, services, or donations (i) prohibited by Laws or Network Rules, or (ii) that qualify as Restricted Businesses, unless you have received prior written approval from Stripe;
-
-iii. Submit a Transaction for the full amount owed by the Customer for the Transaction except where you and the Customer agree on a partial shipment (such as receiving a portion of an order), or where the Transaction qualifies for delayed delivery or special order deposits (such as paying for a deposit on a custom-built product);
-
-iv. Not establish minimum or maximum amounts (except as permitted by the Network Rules), or condition charges for use of VM Payment Cards, and not discourage the use of one VM Payment Card brand over another;
-
-v. Not impose surcharges or taxes (except where permitted by Law and the Network Rules) and, where so done, you will only collect such amounts as part of the submitted charge;
-
-vi. Not submit a Transaction that represents collection of a dishonored check;
-
-vii. Only use the Network logos or marks in a manner permitted by the Network Rules;
-
-viii. Prohibit use of Payment Cards for disbursement of cash (except as permitted by the Network Rules);
-
-ix. Comply with the security obligations identified in the Agreement, including compliance with the PCI Standards and only use cardholder data as permitted, and certify such compliance upon request, and not permit or promote fraudulent use of VM Payment Cards or cardholder data;
-
-x. Make clear to Customers that they are transacting with you prior to, during, and after the Transaction, including providing clear statement descriptors;
-
-xi. Use all reasonable methods to resolve disputes with Customers, including those resulting in a Dispute, and not attempt to recharge a Customer for a Transaction that was previously Disputed and subsequently returned to you unless the recharge is expressly authorized by the Customer; and
-
-xii. Provide clear refund and exchange language that is consistent with Laws and the Network Rules.
-
-4. Authorization for Settlement and Disbursement of Funds
-When Member Bank receives funds from the Networks for settlement of your Card Payments (“Settlement Funds”), Member Bank will provide the Settlement Funds to Stripe or Stripe Payments Company, which will accept the Settlement Funds on your behalf. You agree to designate Stripe and Stripe Payments Company as your agent for purposes of receiving Settlement Funds, and you authorize Stripe to instruct Member Bank on your behalf on how and when to make transfers of Settlement Funds to Stripe, including the initiation of holds, receipts, and disbursements of Settlement Funds. Settlement Funds will be held by Stripe in pooled merchant funds accounts pending disbursement to you (or any applicable third-party recipient you have instructed Stripe to make a disbursement to on your behalf) in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, including these Member Bank Terms.
-
-You agree you are not entitled to access the Settlement Funds prior to the Settlement Funds being credited by Stripe to your User Bank Account (or the bank account of a third-party recipient to which you have instructed Stripe to make a disbursement on your behalf). You further agree that you have no right to direct Member Bank to distribute Settlement Funds, that you may not assign any interest in any Settlement Funds held by Member Bank, and that you are not entitled to any interest or other compensation associated with the Settlement Funds held by Member Bank. Any authorizations set forth in these Member Bank Terms will remain in full force and effect until your Stripe Account is closed or terminated.
-
-You agree that Member Bank’s transfer of Settlement Funds to your designated agents, Stripe or Stripe Payments Company, satisfies Member Bank’s settlement obligation to you, and that, after Member Bank transfers Settlement Funds to Stripe or Stripe Payments Company, any dispute or claim you may have regarding the receipt or amount of Settlement Funds will be between you and Stripe or Stripe Payments Company. Further, if a cardholder disputes a Transaction, if a Transaction is Disputed for any reason, or if Member Bank reasonably believes a Transaction is unauthorized or otherwise unacceptable, the amount of such Transaction may be Disputed and debited from Settlement Funds held by Member Bank.
-
-5. Sharing of Data
-a. You authorize Stripe and Member Bank to provide Protected Data to each other to (i) provide the VM Payment Processing Services, (ii) comply with legal and regulatory obligations, and (iii) perform underwriting and risk review, including verification that you are legally permitted to transact and receive funds. This includes sharing information you provided to Stripe before these Member Bank Terms became effective and information about Member Bank and Stripe’s experience with you, such as termination of these Member Bank Terms by Member Bank and the reasons for such termination. Where required to comply with our obligations under Laws, the Network Rules, or any of Member Bank’s regulatory obligations, Member Bank may provide any data to law enforcement, the Networks, or other government regulators.
-
-b. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires each financial institution to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who establishes a customer relationship with the financial institution. To comply with this requirement, you authorize and direct Stripe to provide to Member Bank any information required to verify your identity, including your name, address, and taxpayer identification number. If you are a legal entity, including a limited liability company or corporation, you authorize and direct Stripe to provide Member Bank with information on the identity of (1) all beneficial owners of 25% or more of the company; and (2) at least one individual with significant control over the company.
-
-6. Term and Termination
-These Member Bank Termsbecome effective as provided in the introductory paragraphs and shall continue in effect so long as you use the VM Payment Processing Services.These Member Bank Terms will terminate automatically upon termination of the Agreement, except for those terms which are intended to survive termination. In addition, the VM Payment Processing Services and/or these Member Bank Terms may be terminated by Member Bank, Stripe, or either Network as provided in the introductory paragraphs.
-

-THE SERVICES DESCRIBED IN THESE MEMBER BANK TERMS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, QUALITY, SUITABILTY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. ALL DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES PROVIDED IN THE AGREEMENT WILL APPLY EQUALLY TO THE MEMBER BANK ENTITIES AS THEY DO TO STRIPE. THE MEMBER BANK ENTITIES (A) ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OR STRIPE’S FAILURE TO PERFORM OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENT AND (B) DO NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE ADVERTISED OR OFFERED BY YOU, STRIPE, OR ANY THIRD PARTY.
-
-10. Limitations on Liability
-In no event will the Member Bank Entities be liable for any lost profits, lost revenue, lost business opportunity, loss of data, or any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages arising out of, in connection with, or relating to the Agreement, these Member Bank Terms, or the VM Payment Processing Services described in either, including without limitation the use of, inability to use, or unavailability of services provided by Stripe. Under no circumstances will any of the Member Bank Entities be responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access, or use of the VM Payment Processing Services, your Stripe Account, or Protected Data, or your failure to use or implement security, controls, or processes that are appropriate for your business.
-
-The Member Bank Entities assume no liability or responsibility for any (a) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to or use of the VM Payment Processing Services; (b) any misuse of VM Payment Processing Services or Protected Data; (c) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the VM Payment Processing Services; (d) any software bugs, viruses, or other harmful code that may be transmitted to, through, or in connection with the VM Payment Processing Services; (e) any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions in the VM Payment Processing Services or data, or any loss or damage resulting therefrom, regardless of the manner of transmission; or (f) defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party.
-
-The Member Bank Entities’ cumulative liability to you is limited to direct damages and in all events will not exceed in the aggregate the amount of fees or compensation actually received by Member Bank from Stripe for the Transactions processed for you through the VM Payment Processing Services during the three (3) month period immediately preceding the event that gives rise to the claim for liability. The limitation of liability in the preceding sentence will not apply to claims by you against Member Bank for direct damages for failure to transfer Settlement Funds to Stripe in accordance with Section 4 of these Member Bank Terms, in which case Member Bank liability for such direct claim by you is limited to the amount of any Settlement Funds that Member Bank failed to transfer to Stripe in accordance with Section 4 of these Member Bank Terms.
-
-Without limiting anything to the contrary above, you agree to provide Member Bank, via a communication with Stripe, with written notice of any alleged breach by Member Bank of these Member Bank Terms, which notice will specifically detail such alleged breach, within sixty (60) days of the date on which you discovered or reasonably should have discovered the alleged breach. Failure to provide notice shall be deemed an acceptance by you and a waiver of any and all rights to dispute such breach.
-
-The foregoing will apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction and will apply regardless of the legal theory on which the claim is based, including without limitation contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other basis. The limitations apply even if Stripe or Member Bank have been advised of the possibility of such damage.
-
-11. United States Only Services; No Illegal Activities
-You may not use the VM Payment Processing Services or services of any kind offered by Member Bank from, or on behalf of persons or entities (a) in a country embargoed by the United States or (b) blocked or denied by the United States government. You further acknowledge and agree that you will not use your Stripe Account and/or the VM Payment Processing Services for illegal Transactions, for example, those prohibited by the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, 31 U.S.C. Section 5361 et seq., as may be amended from time to time, or those involving any Person listed on the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (available at www.treas.gov/ofac) or the U.S. Department of State Terrorist Exclusion List (available at www.state.gov) or the processing and acceptance of Transactions in certain jurisdictions pursuant to 31 CFR Part 500 et seq. and other laws enforced by OFAC. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, the VM Payment Processing Services are solely for use by you in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

-12. Dispute Resolution
-All disputes under these Member Bank Terms are subject to the applicable provisions of the Agreement. In particular, the dispute resolution, class action waiver, and arbitration provisions of the Agreement apply to disputes under these Member Bank Terms by, with, or against Member Bank in the same manner they apply to disputes by, with, or against Stripe, except that (a) in the event of arbitration, only a federal court (and not an arbitrator) may determine whether a particular claim is arbitrable, and (b) service to Member Bank must be made to its registered agent or to PNC Bank, N.A., 1600 Market Street, 8th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103.
-
-13. Waiver
-The failure of Member Bank to assert any of its rights under these Member Bank Terms or the Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver by Member Bank of its rights to enforce each and every provision of these Member Bank Terms or the Agreement in accordance with their terms. These Member Bank Terms may be amended by Member Bank or Stripe from time to time in the same manner as the Agreement may be amended by Stripe.
-
-14. Miscellaneous

These Member Bank Terms may not be assigned by you without the prior written consent of Member Bank and Stripe. These Member Bank Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, transferees, and assignees. If any provision of these Member Bank Terms are determined to be illegal or invalid, such illegality or invalidity of that provision will not affect any of the remaining provisions and these Member Bank Terms will be construed as if such provision is not contained in these Member Bank Terms.

Thank god I had an angel watcheling over my shoulder because I didn't realize it being a mad ass snot nosed kid that has made some ugly orange coin after being promoted that I made a creation that didn't have an object I'd. And needed to be named and given an I'd. And finished being created to have a fully contrusted object so I drug a picture to the yellow drag img here dialog box, and then because it was enlayed upon one another it made me choose a colour after I didn't like the black one It produced automatically from the png it produced automatically from the image I had pulled into the dialog box
I accidentally implimentred a confidential token into the item i.d. area that was an unproduced un identifiable non recorded item in the database library and needed to be given a name a number and a look so it wasn't a warning that popped up it was a blessing 🤣 object_token@Iixixi.git {object_token@Iixixi.git})value bitore now called bitcoin given to Vanyessa Countryman by Zachry wood at age 9

The dns.message.Message Class
This is the base class for all messages, and the class used for any DNS opcodes that do not have a more specific class.

classdns.message.Message(id=none of your business it was private repository)[]
A DNS message.

id
An int, the query id; the default is a randomly chosen id.

flags
An int, the DNS flags of the message.

sections
A list of lists of dns.rrset.RRset objects.

edns
An int, the EDNS level to use. The default is -1, no EDNS.

ednsflags
An int, the EDNS flags.

payload
An int, the EDNS payload size. The default is 0.

options
The EDNS options, a list of dns.edns.Option objects. The default is the empty list.

''{request}'{(token)}'{{[payload]}}''
'Pull'request'':''{''bitore'unlimited''}'{''[3413]''}'[464000000000.00]://Contruct:ref: container@iixixi/repositories/ad_new_container@user/bin/workflow/name/type:@iixixi/iixixi/Read.md

The associated request’s EDNS payload size. This field is meaningful in response messages, and if set to a non-zero value, will limit the size of the response to the specified size. The default is 0, which means “use the default limit” which is currently 34173.

keyring
A dns.tsig.Key, the TSIG key. The default is None.

keyname
The TSIG keyname to use, a dns.name.Name. The default is None.

keyalgorithm
A dns.name.Name, the TSIG algorithm to use. Defaults to dns.tsig.default_algorithm. Constants for TSIG algorithms are defined the in dns.tsig module.

request_mac
A bytes, the TSIG MAC of the request message associated with this message; used when validating TSIG signatures.

fudge
An int, the TSIG time fudge. The default is 300 seconds.

original_id
An int, the TSIG original id; defaults to the message’s id.

tsig_error
An int, the TSIG error code. The default is 0.

other_data
A bytes, the TSIG “other data”. The default is the empty bytes.

mac
A bytes, the TSIG MAC for this message.

xfr
A bool. This attribute is true when the message being used for the results of a DNS zone transfer. The default is False.

origin
A dns.name.Name. The origin of the zone in messages which are used for zone transfers or for DNS dynamic updates. The default is None.

tsig_ctx
An hmac.HMAC, the TSIG signature context associated with this message. The default is None.

had_tsig
A bool, which is True if the message had a TSIG signature when it was decoded from wire format.

multi
A bool, which is True if this message is part of a multi-message sequence. The default is False. This attribute is used when validating TSIG signatures on messages which are part of a zone transfer.

first
A bool, which is True if this message is stand-alone, or the first of a multi-message sequence. The default is True. This variable is used when validating TSIG signatures on messages which are part of a zone transfer.

index
A dict, an index of RRsets in the message. The index key is (section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers, deleting). The default is {}. Indexing improves the performance of finding RRsets. Indexing can be disabled by setting the index to None.

additional
The additional data section.

answer
The answer section.

authority
The authority section.

find_rrset(section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers=<RdataType.TYPE0: 0>, deleting=None, create=False, force_unique=False)[source]
Find the RRset with the given attributes in the specified section.

section, an int section number, or one of the section attributes of this message. This specifies the the section of the message to search. For example:

my_message.find_rrset(my_message.answer, name, rdclass, rdtype)
my_message.find_rrset(dns.message.ANSWER, name, rdclass, rdtype)
name, a dns.name.Name, the name of the RRset.

rdtype, an int, the type of the RRset.

covers, an int or None, the covers value of the RRset. The default is None.

deleting, an int or None, the deleting value of the RRset. The default is None.

create, a bool. If True, create the RRset if it is not found. The created RRset is appended to section.

force_unique, a bool. If True and create is also True, create a new RRset regardless of whether a matching RRset exists already. The default is False. This is useful when creating DDNS Update messages, as order matters for them.

Raises KeyError if the RRset was not found and create was False.

Returns a dns.rrset.RRset object.

get_rrset(section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers=<RdataType.TYPE0: 0>, deleting=None, create=False, force_unique=False)[source]
Get the RRset with the given attributes in the specified section.

If the RRset is not found, None is returned.

section, an int section number, or one of the section attributes of this message. This specifies the the section of the message to search. For example:

my_message.get_rrset(my_message.answer, name, rdclass, rdtype)
my_message.get_rrset(dns.message.ANSWER, name, rdclass, rdtype)
name, a dns.name.Name, the name of the RRset.

rdclass, an int, the class of the RRset.

rdtype, an int, the type of the RRset.

covers, an int or None, the covers value of the RRset. The default is None.

deleting, an int or None, the deleting value of the RRset. The default is None.

create, a bool. If True, create the RRset if it is not found. The created RRset is appended to section.

force_unique, a bool. If True and create is also True, create a new RRset regardless of whether a matching RRset exists already. The default is False. This is useful when creating DDNS Update messages, as order matters for them.

Returns a dns.rrset.RRset object or None.

is_response(other)[source]
Is other a response this message?

Returns a bool.

opcode()[source]
Return the opcode.

Returns an int.

question
The question section.

rcode()[source]
Return the rcode.

Returns an int.

section_from_number(number)[source]
Return the section list associated with the specified section number.

number is a section number int or the text form of a section name.

Raises ValueError if the section isn’t known.

Returns a list.

section_number(section)[source]
Return the “section number” of the specified section for use in indexing.

section is one of the section attributes of this message.

::Raises:"'pop-up-window'"ObjectItemIdConstValueUnknownwindow-pop,-up:"if the section isn’t known"'

Returns,?,"true?,",

set_opcode(opcode)[source]
Set the opcode.

opcode, an int, is the opcode to set.

set_rcode(rcode)[source]
Set the rcode.

rcode, an int, is the rcode to set.

to_text(origin=None, relativize=True, **kw)[source]
Convert the message to text.

The origin, relativize, and any other keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method.

Returns a str.

to_wire(origin=None, max_size=0, multi=False, tsig_ctx=None, **kw)[source]
Return a string containing the message in DNS compressed wire format.

Additional keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method.

origin, a dns.name.Name or None, the origin to be appended to any relative names. If None, and the message has an origin attribute that is not None, then it will be used.

max_size, an int, the maximum size of the wire format output; default is 0, which means “the message’s request payload, if nonzero, or 65535”.

multi, a bool, should be set to True if this message is part of a multiple message sequence.

tsig_ctx, a dns.tsig.HMACTSig or dns.tsig.GSSTSig object, the ongoing TSIG context, used when signing zone transfers.

Raises dns.exception.TooBig if max_size was exceeded.

Returns a bytes.

use_edns(edns=0, ednsflags=0, payload=1232, request_payload=None, options=None)[source]
Configure EDNS behavior.

edns, an int, is the EDNS level to use. Specifying None, False, or -1 means “do not use EDNS”, and in this case the other parameters are ignored. Specifying True is equivalent to specifying 0, i.e. “use EDNS0”.

ednsflags, an int, the EDNS flag values.

payload, an int, is the EDNS sender’s payload field, which is the maximum size of UDP datagram the sender can handle. I.e. how big a response to this message can be.

request_payload, an int, is the EDNS payload size to use when sending this message. If not specified, defaults to the value of payload.

options, a list of dns.edns.Option objects or None, the EDNS options.

use_tsig(keyring, keyname=None, fudge=300, original_id=None, tsig_error=0, other_data=b'', algorithm=)[source]
When sending, a TSIG signature using the specified key should be added.

key, a dns.tsig.Key is the key to use. If a key is specified, the keyring and algorithm fields are not used.

keyring, a dict, callable or dns.tsig.Key, is either the TSIG keyring or key to use.

The format of a keyring dict is a mapping from TSIG key name, as dns.name.Name to dns.tsig.Key or a TSIG secret, a bytes. If a dict keyring is specified but a keyname is not, the key used will be the first key in the keyring. Note that the order of keys in a dictionary is not defined, so applications should supply a keyname when a dict keyring is used, unless they know the keyring contains only one key. If a callable keyring is specified, the callable will be called with the message and the keyname, and is expected to return a key.

keyname, a dns.name.Name, str or None, the name of thes TSIG key to use; defaults to None. If keyring is a dict, the key must be defined in it. If keyring is a dns.tsig.Key, this is ignored.

fudge, an int, the TSIG time fudge.

original_id, an int, the TSIG original id. If None, the message’s id is used.

tsig_error, an int, the TSIG error code.

other_data, a bytes, the TSIG other data.

algorithm, a dns.name.Name, the TSIG algorithm to use. This is only used if keyring is a dict, and the key entry is a bytes.

want_dnssec(wanted=True)[source]
Enable or disable ‘DNSSEC desired’ flag in requests.

wanted, a bool. If True, then DNSSEC data is desired in the response, EDNS is enabled if required, and then the DO bit is set. If False, the DO bit is cleared if EDNS is enabled.

The following constants may be used to specify sections in the find_rrset() and get_rrset() methods:

dns.message.QUESTION= <MessageSection.QUESTION: 0>
Message sections

dns.message.ANSWER= <MessageSection.ANSWER: 1>
Message sections

dns.message.AUTHORITY= <MessageSection.AUTHORITY: 2>
Message sections

dns.message.ADDITIONAL= <MessageSection.ADDITIONAL: 3>
Message sections
