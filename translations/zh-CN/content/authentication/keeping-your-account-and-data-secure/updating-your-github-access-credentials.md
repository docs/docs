## Requesting a new password

1. To request a new password, visit {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}https://{% data variables.product.product_url %}/password_reset{% else %}`https://{% data variables.product.product_url %}/password_reset`{% endif %}.
2. Enter the email address associated with your account on {% ifversion ghae %}{% data variables.product.product_name %}{% else %}{% data variables.location.product_location %}{% endif %}, then click **Send password reset email.** The email will be sent to the backup email address if you have one configured.
  ![Password reset email request dialog](/assets/images/help/settings/password-recovery-email-request.png)
3. We'll email you a link that will allow you to reset your password. You must click on this link within 3 hours of receiving the email. If you didn't receive an email from us, make sure to check your spam folder.
4. If you have enabled two-factor authentication, you will be prompted for your 2FA credentials:
{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
   * If you have {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}, you will be sent a push notification to verify your identity. Open the push notification or the {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} app and enter the two-digit code shown to you on the password reset page in your browser.
   ![Two-factor {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} authentication prompt](/assets/images/help/2fa/2fa-mobile-challenge-password-reset.png)
      * To skip using GitHub Mobile to verify, click **Enter two-factor authentication or recovery code**.
      ![Two-factor GitHub Mobile authentication prompt on {% data variables.product.product_name %} with "Enter two-factor authentication or recovery code" highlighted](/assets/images/help/2fa/2fa-github-mobile-password-reset.png)
{% endif %}
   * Type your authentication code or one of your recovery codes and click **Verify**.
      ![Two-factor authentication prompt](/assets/images/help/2fa/2fa-password-reset.png)
     * If you have added a security key to your account, click **Use security key** instead of typing an authentication code.
     {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
     * If you have set up [{% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}](https://github.com/mobile), click **Authenticate with GitHub Mobile** instead.
     {% endif %}
5. Type a new password, confirm your new password, and click **Change password**. For help creating a strong password, see "[Creating a strong password](/articles/creating-a-strong-password)."
  {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}![Password recovery box](/assets/images/help/settings/password-recovery-page.png){% else %}
  ![Password recovery box](/assets/images/enterprise/settings/password-recovery-page.png){% endif %}

{% tip %}

To avoid losing your password in the future, we suggest using a secure password manager, like [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) or [1Password](https://1password.com/).

{% endtip %}

## Changing an existing password

{% data reusables.repositories.blocked-passwords %}

1. {% data variables.product.signin_link %} to {% data variables.product.product_name %}.
{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.security %}
4. Under "Change password", type your old password, a strong new password, and confirm your new password. For help creating a strong password, see "[Creating a strong password](/articles/creating-a-strong-password)"
5. Click **Update password**.

{% tip %}

For greater security, enable two-factor authentication in addition to changing your password. See [About two-factor authentication](/articles/about-two-factor-authentication) for more details.

{% endtip %}
{% endif %}
## Updating your access tokens

See "[Reviewing your authorized integrations](/articles/reviewing-your-authorized-integrations)" for instructions on reviewing and deleting access tokens. To generate new access tokens, see "[Creating a {% data variables.product.pat_generic %}](/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)."

{% ifversion not ghae %}

If you have reset your account password and would also like to trigger a sign-out from the {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} app, you can revoke your authorization of the "GitHub iOS" or "GitHub Android" OAuth App. This will sign out all instances of the {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} app associated with your account. For additional information, see "[Reviewing your authorized integrations](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/reviewing-your-authorized-integrations)."

{% endif %}

## Updating your SSH keys

See "[Reviewing your SSH keys](/articles/reviewing-your-ssh-keys)" for instructions on reviewing and deleting SSH keys. To generate and add new SSH keys, see "[Generating an SSH key](/articles/generating-an-ssh-key)."

## Resetting API tokens

If you have any applications registered with {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you'll want to reset their OAuth tokens. For more information, see the "[Reset an authorization](/rest/reference/apps#reset-an-authorization)" endpoint.

{% ifversion not ghae %}

"FEDERAL ACCOUNT SYMBOLS AND TITLES (FAST) BOOK
(Agency Identifier Codes)
SUPPLEMENT TO VOLUME I TREASURY FINANCIAL MANUAL
Receipt, appropriation, and other fund account symbols and titles are assigned by the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) consistent with the principles and standards prescribed by the Comptroller General of the United States. This release contains account symbols and titles assigned by the Treasury. The FAST Book information is presented in four parts:
     Part I - Receipt Account Symbols and Titles
     Part II - Appropriation and Other Fund Account Symbols and Titles
     Part III - Foreign Currency Account Symbols and Titles
     Part IV - Indices to Appropriation and Other Fund Account Symbols and Titles
Part I contains receipt accounts arranged numerically within each fund group; that is, general, special, and trust. General fund miscellaneous receipt accounts (within the range 0613 through 3885) are categorized by major classes and account groups.
Definitions are shown immediately following each major class and each account group for use by agencies as a guide in classifying deposits and other credits to the appropriate receipt account symbol and title shown under the definition of each account group. Citations to the United States Code (U.S.C.), or United States Statutes at Large, are shown for special and trust fund receipt accounts.
Part II contains appropriation and other fund accounts for each agency, which are arranged numerically within each fund group; that is, general, revolving, special, deposit, and trust. In this section, accounts are listed by the three-digit agency identifier codes. The previous two-digit department regular codes are shown in parentheses after the agency’s name as a reference. An index for these accounts by (1) agency name in alphabetical order; and (2) agency index number in numerical sequence, is included at the end of this book to assist the user in locating the account for an agency. Citations to the U.S.C. or United States Statutes at Large are shown for the revolving, special, deposit, and trust fund accounts.
Each page in Parts I and II of the publication carries a page number code associating it with that part: R-Part I Receipt Accounts and A-Part II Appropriation and Other Fund Accounts.
Part III contains foreign currency accounts assigned for use in accounting and reporting for receipts, disbursements, sales for dollars, and balances of foreign currencies originally acquired by the United States Government without payment of dollars, and for currencies held in trust. The page number code for this section is FC.
Part IV contains the alphabetical and numerical indices, and the page number code for this section is I."

+## New contributor guide
+
+To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:
+
+- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
+- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
+- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
+- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)
+
+
+## Getting started
+
+To navigate our codebase with confidence, see [the introduction to working in the docs repository](/contributing/working-in-docs-repository.md) :confetti_ball:. For more information on how we write our markdown files, see [the GitHub Markdown reference](contributing/content-markup-reference.md).
+
+Check to see what [types of contributions](/contributing/types-of-contributions.md) we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code :sparkles:.
+
+### Issues
+
+#### Create a new issue
+
+If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). 
+
+#### Solve an issue
+
+Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.
+
+### Make Changes
+
+#### Make changes in the UI
+
+Click **Make a contribution** at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the `.md` file where you can make your changes and [create a pull request](#pull-request) for a review. 
+
+ <img src="./assets/images/contribution_cta.png" width="300" height="150" /> 
+
+#### Make changes in a codespace
+
+For more information about using a codespace for working on GitHub documentation, see "[Working in a codespace](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/codespace.md)."
+
+#### Make changes locally
+
+1. [Install Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/versioning-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).
+
+2. Fork the repository.
+- Using GitHub Desktop:
+  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
+  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!
+
+- Using the command line:
+  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
+
+3. Install or update to **Node.js v16**. For more information, see [the development guide](contributing/development.md).
+
+4. Create a working branch and start with your changes!
+
+### Commit your update
+
+Commit the changes once you are happy with them. See [Atom's contributing guide](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-messages) to know how to use emoji for commit messages.
+
+Once your changes are ready, don't forget to [self-review](/contributing/self-review.md) to speed up the review process:zap:.
+
+### Pull Request
+
+When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
+- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. 
+- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
+- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
+Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
+- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
+- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
+- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
+
+### Your PR is merged!
+
+Congratulations :tada::tada: The GitHub team thanks you :sparkles:. 
+
+Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [GitHubs docs](https://docs.github.com/en). 
+
+Now that you are part of the GitHub docs community, see how else you can [contribute to the docs](/contributing/types-of-contributions.md).
+
+## Windows
+
+This site can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind:
+
+1. Regular Expressions: Windows uses `\r\n` for line endings, while Unix based systems use `\n`. Therefore when working on Regular Expressions, use `\r?\n` instead of `\n` in order to support both environments. The Node.js [`os.EOL`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_eol) property can be used to get an OS-specific end-of-line marker.
+2. Paths: Windows systems use `\` for the path separator, which would be returned by `path.join` and others. You could use `path.posix`, `path.posix.join` etc and the [slash](https://ghub.io/slash) module, if you need forward slashes - like for constructing URLs - or ensure your code works with either.
+3. Bash: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, so it's generally preferred to write [scripts](/script) in JavaScript instead of Bash.
+4. Filename too long error: There is a 260 character limit for a filename when Git is compiled with `msys`. While the suggestions below are not guaranteed to work and could possibly cause other issues, a few workarounds include:
+    - Update Git configuration: `git config --system core.longpaths true`
+    - Consider using a different Git client on Windows

+
+
+The github.dev web-based editor is a lightweight editing experience that runs entirely in your browser. You can navigate files and source code repositories from GitHub, and make and commit code changes.
+
+
+There are two ways to go directly to a VS Code environment in your browser and start coding:
+
+
+* Press the . key on any repository or pull request.
+
+* Swap `.com` with `.dev` in the URL. For example, this repo https://github.com/github/dev becomes http://github.dev/github/dev
+
+
+Preview the gif below to get a quick demo of github.dev in action.
+
+
+![github dev](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/856858/130119109-4769f2d7-9027-4bc4-a38c-10f297499e8f.gif)
+
+
+# Why?
+
+It’s a quick way to edit and navigate code. It's especially useful if you want to edit multiple files at a time or take advantage of all the powerful code editing features of Visual Studio Code when making a quick change. For more information, see our [documentation](https://github.co/codespaces-editor-help).

+# Telegram iOS Source Code Compilation Guide
+
+We welcome all developers to use our API and source code to create applications on our platform.
+There are several things we require from **all developers** for the moment.
+
+# Creating your Telegram Application
+
+1. [**Obtain your own api_id**](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id) for your application.
+2. Please **do not** use the name Telegram for your app — or make sure your users understand that it is unofficial.
+3. Kindly **do not** use our standard logo (white paper plane in a blue circle) as your app's logo.
+3. Please study our [**security guidelines**](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/security_guidelines) and take good care of your users' data and privacy.
+4. Please remember to publish **your** code too in order to comply with the licences.
+
+# Compilation Guide
+
+1. Install Xcode (directly from https://developer.apple.com/download/more or using the App Store).
+2. Clone the project from GitHub:
+
+```
+git clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS.git
+```
+
+3. Adjust configuration parameters
+
+```
+mkdir -p $HOME/telegram-configuration
+cp -R build-system/example-configuration/* $HOME/telegram-configuration/
+```
+
+- Modify the values in `variables.bzl`
+- Replace the provisioning profiles in `provisioning` with valid files
+
+4. (Optional) Create a build cache directory to speed up rebuilds
+
+```
+mkdir -p "$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache"
+```
+
+5. Build the app
+
+```
+python3 build-system/Make/Make.py \
+    --cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
+    build \
+    --configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
+    --buildNumber=100001 \
+    --configuration=release_universal
+```
+
+6. (Optional) Generate an Xcode project
+
+```
+python3 build-system/Make/Make.py \
+    --cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
+    generateProject \
+    --configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
+    --disableExtensions
+```
+
+It is possible to generate a project that does not require any codesigning certificates to be installed: add `--disableProvisioningProfiles` flag:
+```
+python3 build-system/Make/Make.py \
+    --cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
+    generateProject \
+    --configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
+    --disableExtensions \
+    --disableProvisioningProfiles
+```
+
+
+Tip: use `--disableExtensions` when developing to speed up development by not building application extensions and the WatchOS app.
+
+
+# Tips
+
+Bazel is used to build the app. To simplify the development setup a helper script is provided (`build-system/Make/Make.py`). See help:
+
+```
+python3 build-system/Make/Make.py --help
+python3 build-system/Make/Make.py build --help
+python3 build-system/Make/Make.py generateProject --help
+```
+
+Bazel is automatically downloaded when running Make.py for the first time. If you wish to use your own build of Bazel, pass `--bazel=path-to-bazel`. If your Bazel version differs from that in `versions.json`, you may use `--overrideBazelVersion` to skip the version check.
+
+Each release is built using specific Xcode and Bazel versions (see `versions.json`). The helper script checks the versions of installed software and reports an error if they don't match the ones specified in `versions.json`. There are flags that allow to bypass these checks:
+
+```
+python3 build-system/Make/Make.py --overrideBazelVersion build ... # Don't check the version of Bazel
+python3 build-system/Make/Make.py --overrideXcodeVersion build ... # Don't check the version of Xcode
+```

 # Telegram iOS Source Code Compilation Guide
 
+
+
 We welcome all developers to use our API and source code to create applications on our platform.
+
 There are several things we require from **all developers** for the moment.
 
+
+
 # Creating your Telegram Application
 
+
+
 1. [**Obtain your own api_id**](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id) for your application.
+
+
 2. Please **do not** use the name Telegram for your app — or make sure your users understand that it is unofficial.
+
 3. Kindly **do not** use our standard logo (white paper plane in a blue circle) as your app's logo.
+
 3. Please study our [**security guidelines**](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/security_guidelines) and take good care of your users' data and privacy.
+
 4. Please remember to publish **your** code too in order to comply with the licences.
 
+
+
 # Compilation Guide
 
+
+
 1. Install Xcode (directly from https://developer.apple.com/download/more or using the App Store).
+
 2. Clone the project from GitHub:
 
+
+
 ```
+
 git clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS.git
+
 ```
 
+
+
 3. Adjust configuration parameters
 
+
+
 ```
+
 mkdir -p $HOME/telegram-configuration
+
 cp -R build-system/example-configuration/* $HOME/telegram-configuration/
+
 ```
 
+
+
 - Modify the values in `variables.bzl`
+
 - Replace the provisioning profiles in `provisioning` with valid files
 
+
+
 4. (Optional) Create a build cache directory to speed up rebuilds
 
+
+
 ```
+
 mkdir -p "$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache"
+
 ```
 
+
+
 5. Build the app
 
+
+
 ```
+
 python3 build-system/Make/Make.py \
-    --cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
-    build \
-    --configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
-    --buildNumber=100001 \
-    --configuration=release_universal
+
+--cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
+
+build \
+
+--configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
+
+--buildNumber=100001 \
+
+--configuration=release_universal
+
 ```
 
+
+
 6. (Optional) Generate an Xcode project
 
+
+
 ```
+
 python3 build-system/Make/Make.py \
-    --cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
-    generateProject \
-    --configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
-    --disableExtensions
+
+--cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
+
+generateProject \
+
+--configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
+
+--disableExtensions
+
 ```
 
+
+
 It is possible to generate a project that does not require any codesigning certificates to be installed: add `--disableProvisioningProfiles` flag:
+
+
 ```
+
 python3 build-system/Make/Make.py \
-    --cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
-    generateProject \
-    --configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
-    --disableExtensions \
-    --disableProvisioningProfiles
-```
 
+--cacheDir="$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache" \
 
-Tip: use `--disableExtensions` when developing to speed up development by not building application extensions and the WatchOS app.
+generateProject \
 
+--configurationPath="$HOME/telegram-configuration" \
 
+--disableExtensions \ensamableCrescendoProvisioningProfiles
+Tip: use `--disableExtensions` when developing to speed up development by not building application extensions and the WatchOS app.
 # Tips
-
 Bazel is used to build the app. To simplify the development setup a helper script is provided (`build-system/Make/Make.py`). See help:
-
-```
 python3 build-system/Make/Make.py --help
 python3 build-system/Make/Make.py build --help
 python3 build-system/Make/Make.py generateProject --help
-```
+Bazel is automatically downloaded when running Make.py for the first time. If you wish to use your own build of Bazel, pass `--bazel=path-to-bazel`. If your Bazel version differs from 
+that in `versions.json`, you may use `--overrideBazelVersion` to skip the version check.
+Each release is built using specific Xcode and Bazel versions (see `versions.json`). The helper script checks the versions of installed software and reports an error if they don't match 
+the ones specified in `versions.json`. There are flags that allow to bypass these checks:
+Python3 build-system/Make/Make.py --overrideBazelVersion build ... # Don't check the version of Bazel
+Python3 build-system/Make/Make.py --overrideXcodeVersion build ... # Don't check the version of Xcode

+U.S. Treasury Check Security Features
+Ultraviolet Overprinting Pattern
+A protective ultraviolet pattern, invisible to the
+naked eye, consisting of four lines of “FMS” or
+"FISCALSERVICE” bracketed by the “Fiscal
+Service” or “Financial Management Service”
+seal on the left and United States Seal (eagle)
+on the right. This pattern can usually be found
+under the payee information and dollar amount
+area. The FISCAL SERVICE pattern and seals
+can be detected under a black light. If the
+amount box is shaved or altered in any way, a
+space will be created in the ultraviolet area.
+When exposed to black light, the ink used in
+the pattern and the seal will glow. This
+fluorescent quality cannot be photocopied.
+Treasury Seal
+The seal identifies the “Bureau of the Fiscal Service” or
+"Financial Management Service." The previous seal
+reflecting “Financial Management Service” will be seen
+in rotation until this check stock runs out.
+Bleeding Ink
+The Treasury seal, located to the right of the Statue of
+Liberty, contains security ink that will run and turn red
+when moisture is applied to the black ink of the seal.
+Microprinting
+Microprinted words are so small they appear as just a
+line to the naked eye. However, when magnified, they
+become visible. Microprinting cannot be duplicated by a
+copier and when a check is counterfeited, it will often
+show up as a solid line or a series of dots. The U.S.
+Treasury check has three areas where microprinting isconst { files } = await Deno.emit("./mod.ts", {
  check: false,
});
Setting check to false will instruct Deno to not utilise the TypeScript compiler to type check the code and emit it, instead only transpiling the code from within Deno. This can be significantly quicker than doing the full type checking.

Compiler options
Deno.emit() supports quite a few compiler options that can impact how code is type checked and emitted. They are similar to the options supported by a tsconfig.json in the compilerOptions section, but there are several options that are not supported. This is because they are either meaningless in Deno or would cause Deno to not be able to work properly. The defaults for Deno.emit() are the same defaults that are on the command line. The options are documented here along with their default values and are built into the Deno types.

If you are type checking your code, the compiler options will be type checked for you, but if for some reason you are either dynamically providing the compiler options or are not type checking, then the result of Deno.emit
+used.
+Watermark
+All U.S. Treasury checks are printed on
+watermarked paper. The watermark
+reads “U.S. TREASURY” and can be
+seen from both the front and back of the
+check when held up to a light. The
+watermark is light and cannot be
+reproduced by a copier. Any check not
+having the watermark should be
+suspected as being counterfeit or copied.
