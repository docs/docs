## About the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %}

The {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} introduces a lightweight editing experience that runs entirely in your browser. With the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %}, you can navigate files and source code repositories from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, and make and commit code changes. You can open any repository, fork, or pull request in the editor.

The {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} is available to everyone for free on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}.

The {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} provides many of the benefits of {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %}, such as search, syntax highlighting, and a source control view. You can also use Settings Sync to share your own {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %} settings with the editor. For more information, see "[Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %} documentation.

The {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} runsâ€¯entirely in your browserâ€™s sandbox. The editor doesnâ€™t clone the repository, but instead uses the [GitHub Repositories extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github#_github-repositories-extension) to carry out most of the functionality that you will use. Your work is saved in the browserâ€™s local storage until you commit it. You should commit your changes regularly to ensure that they're always accessible.

You must be signed in to use the web-based editor.

## Opening the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %}

You can open any {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repository in the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} in either of the following ways:

- To open the repository in the same browser tab, press <kbd>.</kbd> while browsing any repository or pull request on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.
 
  To open the repository in a new browser tab, press <kbd>></kbd>.

## {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} and the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %}

Both the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} allow you to edit your code straight from your repository. However, both have slightly different benefits, depending on your use case.

|| {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} | {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %}|
|-|----------------|---------|
| **Cost** | Free.      | Costs for compute and storage. For information on pricing, see "[About billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %}](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#github-codespaces-pricing)."|
| **Availability** | Available to everyone on GitHub.com. | Available for organizations using GitHub Team or GitHub Enterprise Cloud. |
| **Start up** | The {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} opens instantly with a key-press and you can start using it right away, without having to wait for additional configuration or installation. | When you create or resume a codespace, the codespace is assigned a VM and the container is configured based on the contents of a `devcontainer.json` file. This set up may take a few minutes to create the environment. For more information, see "[Creating a Codespace](/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace)." |
| **Compute**  | There is no associated compute, so you wonâ€™t be able to build and run your code or use the integrated terminal. | With  {%  data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %}, you get the power of dedicated VM on which you can run and debug your application.|
| **Terminal access** | None. | {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} provides a common set of tools by default, meaning that you can use the Terminal exactly as you would in your local environment.|
| **Extensions**  | Only a subset of extensions that can run in the web will appear in the Extensionsâ€¯View and can be installed. For more information, see "[Using extensions](#using-extensions)."| With {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %}, you can use most extensions from the {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_marketplace %}.|

### Continue working on {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %}

You can start your workflow in the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} and continue working on a codespace, provided you have [access to {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %}](/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#access-to-codespaces). If you try to access the Run and Debug View or the Terminal, you'll be notified that they are not available in the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %}.

To continue your work in a codespace, click **Continue Working onâ€¦** and select **Create New Codespace** to create a codespace on your current branch. Before you choose this option, you must commit any changes.

## Using source control

When you use the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %}, all actions are managed through the Source Control View, which is located in the Activity Bar on the left hand side. For more information on the Source Control View, see "[Version Control](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %} documentation.

Because the web-based editor uses the GitHub Repositories extension to power its functionality, you can switch branches without needing to stash changes. For more information, see "[GitHub Repositories](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github#_github-repositories-extension)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %} documentation.

### Create a new branch

{% data reusables.codespaces.create-or-switch-branch %}
  Any uncommitted changes you have made in your old branch will be available on your new branch.

### Commit your changes

2. Press `.` to open the pull request in the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %}.
3. Once you have made any changes, commit them using the steps in [Commit your changes](#commit-your-changes). Your changes will be committed directly to the branch, it's not necessary to push the changes.

## Using extensions

The {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} supports {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %} extensions that have been specifically created or updated to run in the web. These extensions are known as "web extensions". To learn how you can create a web extension or update your existing extension to work for the web, see "[Web extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/web-extensions)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %} documentation.

Extensions that can run in the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} will appear in the Extensionsâ€¯View and can be installed. If you use Settings Sync, any compatible extensions are also installed automatically. For information, see "[Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %} documentation.


## Troubleshooting

If you have issues opening the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %}, try the following:

- Make sure you are signed in to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.
- Disable any ad blockers.
- Use a non-incognito window in your browser to open the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %}.

### Known limitations

- The {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} is currently supported in Chrome (and various other Chromium-based browsers), Edge, Firefox, and Safari. We recommend that you use the latest versions of these browsers.
- Some keybindings may not work, depending on the browser you are using. These keybinding limitations are documented in the "[Known limitations and adaptations](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/codespaces#_known-limitations-and-adaptations)" section of the {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %} documentation.
- `.` may not work to open the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} according to your local keyboard layout. In that case, you can open any {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repository in the {% data variables.product.prodname_serverless %} by changing the URL from `github.com` to `github.dev`.
