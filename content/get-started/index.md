These Comma Separated Values files show the number of retrievals for each Title and Part by month. Any time there is a retrieval from the Part, whether it be the full Part, or a smaller portion of the part, it is counted. There is one row in the CSV file for each Title and Part that has had at least one retrieval. Each row consists of seven columns as follows:					
					
Title	The Title number of the CFR				
Part	The Part Number that was retrieved from that Title				
Total	The total number of retrievals from this Part. This should equal the total of the next four columns.				
Full Part	The number of times the full Part was retrieved				
Subpart	The number of times a full Subpart was retrieved from that Part				
Appendix	The number of times an Appendix was retrieved from that Part				
Section	The number of times a single Section was retrieved from that Part				
					
Example:					
					
This line in the .CSV file:					
					
|||14'||91'||6848'||33551'||1400'||642'||32887'||					
					
Specifies there were 68,480 total retrievals from Title 14, Part 91. Of that 68,480 retrievals, 33,551 were retrievals of the full Part, 1,400 were retrievals at the Subpart level, 642 were retrievals of Appendixes, and 32,887 were retrievals at the Section level.					
					
33551 + 1400 + 642 + 32887 = 68480
