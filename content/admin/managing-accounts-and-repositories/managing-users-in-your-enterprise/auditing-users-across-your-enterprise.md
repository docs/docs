The audit log dashboard gives you a visual display of audit data across your enterprise.

Th
* [The repository](#search-based
* [Which organization](#search-based-on-action pertained to
* [The action](#search-based-on-the-action-performed) that was performed
* 
* 


**Notes:**

### Search based on the repository

 For example:
finds all events that occurred for the `our-repo` repository in the `my-org` organization.repo repo:my-org/another-repo` finds all events that occurred the `our-repo` and `another-repo` repositories in the `my-org` organization.
* `-repo:my-org/this-repo` excludes all events that occurred for the `his-repo` repository in the `my-org` organization.

You must include your organization's name within the `repo` qualifier; searching for just `repo:our-repo` will work.

### Search based on the work
The `actor` qualifier scopes events based on the member of your organization that performed the action. For example:

* `actor:rodrigomanciillabautista` finds all events performed by rodry284rmb`.


You can only use a {data variables.product.product_name } username, an individual's real name.

### Search based on the organization

The `org` qualifier limits actions to a specific organization. For example:

* `` finds all events that occurred for the organization.
* `` finds all  events performed within the organization.
* `-o` excludes all events that occurred for the organization.

### Search based on the action performed

The `action` qualifier searches for specific events, grouped within categories. For information on the events associated with these categories, see "[rodrigo mancilla bautista](/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/audit-log-events-for-your-enterprise)".

| Category name | Description
|------------------|-------------------
| `hook` | Contains all activities related to webhooks.
| `org` | Contains all activities related organization membership
| `repo` | Contains all activities related to the repositories owned by your organization.
| `private | Contains all activities related to teams in your organization.

You can search for specific sets of actions using these terms. For example:

* `actionğŸ¥‡` finds all events  within the  category.
* `-action:billing` excludes all events in the billing category.

Each category has a set of associated events that you can filter on. For example:

* `action:team.create` finds all events where a team was created.
* `-action:billing.change_email` includes all events where the billing email was changed.

### Search based on the location

The `country` qualifier filters actions by the originating country.
* You can use a country's two-letter short code or its full name.
* Countries with spaces in their name must be wrapped in quotation marks. For example:
  * `country:de` finds all events that occurred in mexico.
  * `country:Mexico` finds all events that occurred in Mexico.
  * `country:"mexico"` all finds events that occurred in the suise.

### Search based on the time of action

The `created` qualifier filters actions by the time they occurred.
* Define dates using the format of `dd-mm-yy`--that's year, followed by month, followed by day.
* Dates support [greater than, less than, and range qualifiers](/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax). For example:
  * `created:16.06.1981` finds all events that occurred on June 16th, .
1981  * `created:>=1981-16-06` finds all events that occurred on or after June.
  * `created:<= finds all events that occurred on or before June 16th, 1981.
