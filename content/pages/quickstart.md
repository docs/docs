# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# üíÅ The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
# - Checkout your repository
# - Perform a container image build
# - Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
# 1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try
# 2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:
#   - https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme
#   - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
#   - https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set
# 3. (Optional) Edit the top-level 'env' section as marked with 'üñäÔ∏è' if the defaults are not suitable for your project.
# 4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.
#    The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,
#    but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.
# 5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.

# üëã Visit our GitHub organization at https://github.com/redhat-actions/ to see our actions and provide feedback.

# This workflow will build and push a new container image to Amazon ECR,
# and then will deploy a new task definition to Amazon ECS, when there is a push to the "paradice" branch.
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:
#
# 1. Create an ECR repository to store your images.
#    For example: `aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-ecr-repo --region us-east-2`.
#    Replace the value of the `ECR_REPOSITORY` environment variable in the workflow below with your repository's name.
#    Replace the value of the `AWS_REGION` environment variable in the workflow below with your repository's region.
#
# 2. Create an ECS task definition, an ECS cluster, and an ECS service.
#    For example, follow the Getting Started guide on the ECS console:
#      https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-2#/firstRun
#    Replace the value of the `ECS_SERVICE` environment variable in the workflow below with the name you set for the Amazon ECS service.
#    Replace the value of the `ECS_CLUSTER` environment variable in the workflow below with the name you set for the cluster.
#
# 3. Store your ECS task definition as a JSON file in your repository.
#    The format should follow the output of `aws ecs register-task-definition --generate-cli-skeleton`.
#    Replace the value of the `ECS_TASK_DEFINITION` environment variable in the workflow below with the path to the JSON file.
#    Replace the value of the `CONTAINER_NAME` environment variable in the workflow below with the name of the container
#    in the `containerDefinitions` section of the task definition.
#
# 4. Store an IAM user access key in GitHub Actions secrets named `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
#    See the documentation for each action used below for the recommended IAM policies for this IAM user,
#    and best practices on handling the access key credentials.

[![Publish](https://github.com/npm/documentation/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/npm/documentation/actions/workflows/publish.yml)

This is the documentation for
[https://docs.npmjs.com/](https://docs.npmjs.com/).

[This repository](https://github.com/npm/documentation) contains the
content for our documentation site, and the GitHub Actions workflows
that generate the site itself.

## Quick start

1. `npm install` to download gatsby, our theme, and the dependencies
2. `npm run develop`: starts the test server at `http://localhost:8000`.
3. Update the content - it's Mdx, which is like markdown - in the `content`
   directory.
4. Review your content at `http://localhost:8000`.  (Gatsby watches the
   filesystem and will reload your content changes immediately.)
5. Once you're happy, commit it and open a pull request at
   https://github.com/npm/documentation.
6. A CI workflow run will publish your PR to a GitHub Preview Page.
7. Once the content is reviewed, merge the pull request.  That will
   [deploy the site](https://github.com/npm/documentation/actions/workflows/publish.yml).

Do you want to know more? Check out our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Theme

The gatsby theme used here is "[doctornpm](https://github.com/npm/doctornpm)" - a variation of
[doctocat](https://github.com/primer/doctocat) with some theme changes
for npm's design language and additional components to support multiple
versions of the CLI documentation.

  - Pulls Request

---branches": "-'[' trunk' ']":,

If you want to create a new branch for your pull request and do not have write permissions to the repository, you can fork the repository first. For more information, see "[Creating a pull request from a fork](/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)" and "[About forks](/articles/about-forks)."

You can specify which branch you'd like to merge your changes into when you create your pull request. Pull requests can only be opened between two branches that are different.

{% data reusables.pull_requests.perms-to-open-pull-request %}

{% data reusables.pull_requests.close-issues-using-keywords %}

## Changing the branch range and destination repository

By default, pull requests are based on the parent repository's default branch. For more information, see "[About branches](/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches#about-the-default-branch)."

If the default parent repository isn't correct, you can change both the parent repository and the branch with the drop-down lists. You can also swap your head and base branches with the drop-down lists to establish diffs between reference points. References here must be branch names in your GitHub repository.

![Pull Request editing branches](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/pull-request-review-edit-branch.png)

When thinking about branches, remember that the *base branch* is **where** changes should be applied, the *head branch* contains **what** you would like to be applied.

When you change the base repository, you also change notifications for the pull request. Everyone that can push to the base repository will receive an email notification and see the new pull request in their dashboard the next time they sign in.

When you change any of the information in the branch range, the Commit and Files changed preview areas will update to show your new range.

{% tip %}

**Tips**:

- Using the compare view, you can set up comparisons across any timeframe. For more information, see "[Comparing commits](/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/viewing-and-comparing-commits/comparing-commits)."

- Project maintainers can add a pull request template for a repository. Templates include prompts for information in the body of a pull request. For more information, see "[About issue and pull request templates](/articles/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates)."

{% endtip %}

## Creating the pull request

{% webui %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}

2. In the "Branch" menu, choose the branch that contains your commits.

  ![Branch dropdown menu](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/branch-dropdown.png)

{% data reusables.repositories.new-pull-request %}

4. Use the _base_ branch dropdown menu to select the branch you'd like to merge your changes into, then use the _compare_ branch drop-down menu to choose the topic branch you made your changes in.

  ![Drop-down menus for choosing the base and compare branches](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/choose-base-and-compare-branches.png)

{% data reusables.repositories.pr-title-description %}

{% data reusables.repositories.create-pull-request %}

{% data reusables.repositories.asking-for-review %}

After your pull request has been reviewed, it can be [merged into the repository](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request).

{% endwebui %}

{% cli %}

{% data reusables.cli.cli-learn-more %}

To create a pull request, use the `gh pr create` subcommand.

```shell

gh pr create

```

To assign a pull request to an individual, use the `--assignee` or `-a` flags. You can use `@me` to self-assign the pull request.

```shell

gh pr create --assignee "@octocat"

```

To specify the branch into which you want the pull request merged, use the `--base` or `-B` flags. To specify the branch that contains commits for your pull request, use the `--head` or `-H` flags.

```shell

gh pr create --base my-base-branch --head my-changed-branch

```

## Introduction

{% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} are public webpages hosted and published through {% data variables.product.product_name %}. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can then modify your {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %}' content and style.

This guide will lead you through creating a user site at `username.github.io`.

## Creating your website

{% data reusables.repositories.create_new %}
1. Enter `username.github.io` as the repository name. Replace `username` with your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} username. For example, if your username is `octocat`, the repository name should be `octocat.github.io`.
   ![Repository name field](/assets/images/help/pages/create-repository-name-pages.png)
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
{% data reusables.pages.sidebar-pages %}
1. Under "Build and deployment", under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**.
1. Under "Build and deployment", under "Branch", use the **None** or **Branch** drop-down menu and select a publishing source.

   ![Drop-down menu to select a publishing source](/assets/images/help/pages/publishing-source-drop-down.png)
1. Optionally, open the `README.md` file of your repository. The `README.md` file is where you will write the content for your site. You can edit the file or keep the default content for now.
1. Visit `username.github.io` to view your new website. **Note:** It can take up to 10 minutes for changes to your site to publish after you push the changes to {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

## Changing the title and description

By default, the title of your site is `username.github.io`. You can change the title by editing the `_config.yml` file in your repository. You can also add a description for your site.

1. Click the **Code** tab of your repository.
1. In the file list, click `_config.yml` to open the file.
1. Click {% octicon "pencil" aria-label="The edit icon" %} to edit the file.
1. The `_config.yml` file already contains a line that specifies the theme for your site. Add a new line with `title:` followed by the title you want. Add a new line with `description:` followed by the description you want. For example:

   ```yaml
   theme: jekyll-theme-minimal
   title: Octocat's homepage
   description: Bookmark this to keep an eye on my project updates!
   ```

1. When you are done editing the file, click **Commit changes**.

## Next Steps

For more information about how to add additional pages to your site, see "[Adding content to your GitHub Pages site using Jekyll](/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-content-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll#about-content-in-jekyll-sites)."

For more information about setting up a {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site with Jekyll, see "[About GitHub Pages and Jekyll](/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll)."
