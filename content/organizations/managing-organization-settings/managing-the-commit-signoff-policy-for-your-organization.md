## About commit signoffs

To affirm that a commit complies with the rules and licensing governing a repository, many organizations require developers to sign off on every commit. If your organization requires commit signoffs, you can make signing off a seamless part of the commit process by enabling compulsory commit signoffs for users committing through {% data variables.product.product_name %}'s web interface. After you enable compulsory commit signoffs for an organization, every commit made to repositories in that organization through {% data variables.product.product_name %}'s web interface will automatically be signed off on by the commit author.

People with admin access to a repository can also enable compulsory commit signoffs at the repository level. For more information, see "[Managing the commit signoff policy for your repository](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-the-commit-signoff-policy-for-your-repository)."

+Create Pull Request CI GitHub Marketplace
+A GitHub action to create a pull request for changes to your repository in the actions workspace.
+Changes to a repository in the Actions workspace persist between steps in a workflow. This action is designed to be used in conjunction with other steps that modify or add files to your repository. The changes will be automatically committed to a new branch and a pull request created.
+Create Pull Request action will:
+Check for repository changes in the Actions workspace. This includes:
+untracked (new) files
+tracked (modified) files
+commits made during the workflow that have not been pushed
+Commit all changes to a new branch, or update an existing pull request branch.
+Create a pull request to merge the new branch into the base—the branch checked out in the workflow.
+Documentation
+Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage
+Examples
+Updating to v3
+Usage
+- uses: actions/checkout@v2
+# Make changes to pull request here
+name: Create Pull Request
+uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
+You can also pin to a specific release version in the format @v3.x.x
+Action inputs
+All inputs are optional. If not set, sensible defaults will be used.
+Note: If you want pull requests created by this action to trigge-on: worksflows_call:-on:'Run:run-on:-,oon:Name Description Default
+token GITHUB_TOKEN or a repo scoped Personal Access Token (PAT). GITHUB_TOKEN
+path Relative path under GITHUB_WORKSPACE to the repository. GITHUB_WORKSPACE
+commit-message The message to use when committing changes. [create-pull-request] automated change
+committer The committer name and email address in the format Display Name email@address.com. Defaults to the GitHub Actions bot user. GitHub noreply@github.com
+author The author name and email address in the format Display Name email@address.com. Defaults to the user who triggered the workflow run. {{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com>
+signoff Add Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the commit log message. false
+branch The pull request branch name. create-pull-request/patch
+delete-branch Delete the branch when closing pull requests, and when undeleted after merging. Recommend true. false
+branch-suffix The branch suffix type when using the alternative branching strategy. Valid values are random, timestamp and short-commit-hash. See Alternative strategy for details.
+base Sets the pull request base branch. Defaults to the branch checked out in the workflow.
+push-to-fork A fork of the checked-out parent repository to which the pull request branch will be pushed. e.g. owner/repo-fork. The pull request will be created to merge the fork's branch into the parent's base. See push pull request branches to a fork for details.
+title The title of the pull request. Changes by create-pull-request action
+body The body of the pull request. Automated changes by create-pull-request GitHub action
+labels A comma or newline-separated list of labels.
+assignees A comma or newline-separated list of assignees (GitHub usernames).
+reviewers A comma or newline-separated list of reviewers (GitHub usernames) to request a review from.
+team-reviewers A comma or newline-separated list of GitHub teams to request a review from. Note that a repo scoped PAT may be required. See this issue.
+milestone The number of the milestone to associate this pull request with.
+draft Create a draft pull request. false
+Action outputs
+The pull request number and URL are available as step outputs. Note that in order to read the step outputs the action step must have an id.
+  - name: Create Pull Request
+    id: cpr
+    uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
+  - name: Check outputs
+    run: |
+      echo "Pull Request Number - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}"
+      echo "Pull Request URL - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-url }}"
+Action behaviour
+The default behaviour of the action is to create a pull request that will be continually updated with new changes until it is merged or closed. Changes are committed and pushed to a fixed-name branch, the name of which can be configured with the branch input. Any subsequent changes will be committed to the same branch and reflected in the open pull request.
+How the action behaves:
+If there are changes (i.e. a diff exists with the checked-out base branch), the changes will be pushed to a new branch and a pull request created.
+If there are no changes (i.e. no diff exists with the checked-out base branch), no pull request will be created and the action exits silently.
+If a pull request already exists and there are no further changes (i.e. no diff with the current pull request branch) then the action exits silently.
+If a pull request exists and new changes on the base branch make the pull request unnecessary (i.e. there is no longer a diff between the pull request branch and the base), the pull request is automatically closed. Additionally, if delete-branch is set to true the branch will be deleted.
+For further details about how the action works and usage guidelines, see Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage.
+Alternative strategy - Always create a new pull request branch
+For some use cases it may be desirable to always create a new unique branch each time there are changes to be committed. This strategy is not recommended because if not used carefully it could result in multiple pull requests being created unnecessarily. If in doubt, use the default strategy of creating an updating a fixed-name branch.
+To use this strategy, set input branch-suffix with one of the following options.
+random - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with a random alpha-numeric string. e.g. create-pull-request/patch-6qj97jr, create-pull-request/patch-5jrjhvd
+timestamp - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed by a timestamp. e.g. create-pull-request/patch-1569322532, create-pull-request/patch-1569322552
+short-commit-hash - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with the short SHA1 commit hash. e.g. create-pull-request/patch-fcdfb59, create-pull-request/patch-394710b
+Controlling commits
+As well as relying on the action to handle uncommitted changes, you can additionally make your own commits before the action runs. Note that the repository must be checked out on a branch with a remote, it won't work for events which checkout a commit.
+steps:
+  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
+  - name: Create commits
+    run: |
+      git config user.name 'Peter Evans'
+      git config user.email 'peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com'
+      date +%s > report.txt
+      git commit -am "Modify tracked file during workflow"
+      date +%s > new-report.txt
+      git add -A
+      git commit -m "Add untracked file during workflow"
+  - name: Uncommitted change
+    run: date +%s > report.txt
+  - name: Create Pull Request
+    uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
+Ignoring files
+If there are files or directories you want to ignore you can simply add them to a .gitignore file at the root of your repository. The action will respect this file.
+Create a project card
+To create a project card for the pull request, pass the pull-request-number step output to create-or-update-project-card action.
+  - name: Create Pull Request
+    id: cpr
+    uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
+name: Create or Update Project Card
+uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card@v1
+with:
+project-name: My project
+column-name: My column
+issue-number: ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}
+Reference Example
+The following workflow sets many of the action's inputs for reference purposes. Check the defaults to avoid setting inputs unnecessarily.
+See examples for more realistic use cases.
