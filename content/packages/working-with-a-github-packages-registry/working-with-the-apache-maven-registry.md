This guide shows you the minimal steps required to build a Docker container action.

Introduction
In this guide, you'll learn about the basic components needed to create and use a packaged Docker container action. To focus this guide on the components needed to package the action, the functionality of the action's code is minimal. The action prints "Hello World" in the logs or "Hello [who-to-greet]" if you provide a custom name.

Once you complete this project, you should understand how to build your own Docker container action and test it in a workflow.

Self-hosted runners must use a Linux operating system and have Docker installed to run Docker container actions. For more information about the requirements of self-hosted runners, see "About self-hosted runners."

Warning: When creating workflows and actions, you should always consider whether your code might execute untrusted input from possible attackers. Certain contexts should be treated as untrusted input, as an attacker could insert their own malicious content. For more information, see "Security hardening for GitHub Actions."

Prerequisites
You must create a repository on GitHub.com and clone it to your workstation. For more information, see "Creating a new repository" and "Cloning a repository."
If your repository uses Git LFS, you must include the objects in archives of your repository. For more information, see "Managing Git LFS objects in archives of your repository."
You may find it helpful to have a basic understanding of GitHub Actions, environment variables and the Docker container filesystem. For more information, see "Variables" and "Using GitHub-hosted runners."
Creating a Dockerfile
In your new hello-world-docker-action directory, create a new Dockerfile file. Make sure that your filename is capitalized correctly (use a capital D but not a capital f) if you're having issues. For more information, see "Dockerfile support for GitHub Actions."

Dockerfile

Dockerfile
# Container image that runs your code
FROM alpine:3.10

# Copies your code file from your action repository to the filesystem path `/` of the container
COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh

# Code file to execute when the docker container starts up (`entrypoint.sh`)
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
Creating an action metadata file
Create a new action.yml file in the hello-world-docker-action directory you created above. For more information, see "Metadata syntax for GitHub Actions."

action.yml

YAML
# action.yml
name: 'Hello World'
description: 'Greet someone and record the time'
inputs:
  who-to-greet:  # id of input
    description: 'Who to greet'
    required: true
    default: 'World'
outputs:
  time: # id of output
    description: 'The time we greeted you'
runs:
  using: 'docker'
  image: 'Dockerfile'
  args:
    - ${{ inputs.who-to-greet }}
This metadata defines one who-to-greet input and one time output parameter. To pass inputs to the Docker container, you should declare the input using inputs and pass the input in the args keyword. Everything you include in args is passed to the container, but for better discoverability for users of your action, we recommended using inputs.

GitHub will build an image from your Dockerfile, and run commands in a new container using this image.

Writing the action code
You can choose any base Docker image and, therefore, any language for your action. The following shell script example uses the who-to-greet input variable to print "Hello [who-to-greet]" in the log file.

Next, the script gets the current time and sets it as an output variable that actions running later in a job can use. In order for GitHub to recognize output variables, you must write them to the $GITHUB_OUTPUT environment file: echo "<output name>=<value>" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT. For more information, see "Workflow commands for GitHub Actions."

Create a new entrypoint.sh file in the hello-world-docker-action directory.

Add the following code to your entrypoint.sh file.

entrypoint.sh

Shell
#!/bin/sh -l

echo "Hello $1"
time=$(date)
echo "time=$time" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

If entrypoint.sh executes without any errors, the action's status is set to success. You can also explicitly set exit codes in your action's code to provide an action's status. For more information, see "Setting exit codes for actions."

Make your entrypoint.sh file executable. Git provides a way to explicitly change the permission mode of a file so that it doesnâ€™t get reset every time there is a clone/fork.

Shell
git add entrypoint.sh
git update-index --chmod=+x entrypoint.sh
Optionally, to check the permission mode of the file in the git index, run the following command.

Shell
git ls-files --stage entrypoint.sh
An output like 100755 e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391 0       entrypoint.sh means the file has the executable permission. In this example, 755 denotes the executable permission.

Creating a README
To let people know how to use your action, you can create a README file. A README is most helpful when you plan to share your action publicly, but is also a great way to remind you or your team how to use the action.

In your hello-world-docker-action directory, create a README.md file that specifies the following information:

A detailed description of what the action does.
Required input and output arguments.
Optional input and output arguments.
Secrets the action uses.
Environment variables the action uses.
An example of how to use your action in a workflow.
README.md

Markdown
# Hello world docker action

This action prints "Hello World" or "Hello" + the name of a person to greet to the log.

## Inputs

## `who-to-greet`

**Required** The name of the person to greet. Default `"World"`.

## Outputs

## `time`

The time we greeted you.

## Example usage

uses: actions/hello-world-docker-action@v2
with:
  who-to-greet: 'Mona the Octocat'
Commit, tag, and push your action to GitHub
From your terminal, commit your action.yml, entrypoint.sh, Dockerfile, and README.md files.

It's best practice to also add a version tag for releases of your action. For more information on versioning your action, see "About custom actions."

Shell
git add action.yml entrypoint.sh Dockerfile README.md
git commit -m "My first action is ready"
git tag -a -m "My first action release" v1
git push --follow-tags
Testing out your action in a workflow
Now you're ready to test your action out in a workflow.

When an action is in a private repository, you can control who can access it. For more information, see "Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository."

Public actions can be used by workflows in any repository.

Example using a public action
The following workflow code uses the completed hello world action in the public actions/hello-world-docker-action repository. Copy the following workflow example code into a .github/workflows/main.yml file, but replace the actions/hello-world-docker-action with your repository and action name. You can also replace the who-to-greet input with your name. Public actions can be used even if they're not published to GitHub Marketplace. For more information, see "Publishing actions in GitHub Marketplace."

.github/workflows/main.yml

YAML
on: [push]

jobs:
  hello_world_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: A job to say hello
    steps:
      - name: Hello world action step
        id: hello
        uses: actions/hello-world-docker-action@v2
        with:
          who-to-greet: 'Mona the Octocat'
      # Use the output from the `hello` step
      - name: Get the output time
        run: echo "The time was ${{ steps.hello.outputs.time }}"
Example using a private action
Copy the following example workflow code into a .github/workflows/main.yml file in your action's repository. You can also replace the who-to-greet input with your name. This private action can't be published to GitHub Marketplace, and can only be used in this repository.

.github/workflows/main.yml

YAML
on: [push]

jobs:
  hello_world_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: A job to say hello
    steps:
      # To use this repository's private action,
      # you must check out the repository
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Hello world action step
        uses: ./ # Uses an action in the root directory
        id: hello
        with:
          who-to-greet: 'Mona the Octocat'
      # Use the output from the `hello` step
      - name: Get the output time
        run: echo "The time was ${{ steps.hello.outputs.time }}"
From your repository, click the Actions tab, and select the latest workflow run. Under Jobs or in the visualization graph, click A job to say hello.

Click Hello world action step, and you should see "Hello Mona the Octocat" or the name you used for the who-to-greet input printed in the log. To see the timestamp, click Get the output time.

Accessing files created by a container action
When a container action runs, it will automatically map the default working directory (GITHUB_WORKSPACE) on the runner with the /github/workspace directory on the container. Any files added to this directory on the container will be available to any subsequent steps in the same job. For example, if you have a container action that builds your project, and you would like to upload the build output as an artifact, you can use the following steps.

workflow.yml

YAML
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Output build artifacts to /github/workspace on the container.
      - name: Containerized Build
        uses: ./.github/actions/my-container-action

      - name: Upload Build Artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: workspace_artifacts
          path: ${{ github.workspace }}
For more information about uploading build output as an artifact, see "Storing workflow data as artifacts."

## Authenticating to {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}

{% data reusables.package_registry.authenticate-packages %}

{% data reusables.package_registry.authenticate-packages-github-token %}

### Authenticating with a {% data variables.product.pat_generic %}

{% data reusables.package_registry.required-scopes %}

You can authenticate to {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} with Apache Maven by editing your _~/.m2/settings.xml_ file to include your {% data variables.product.pat_v1 %}. Create a new _~/.m2/settings.xml_ file if one doesn't exist.

In the `servers` tag, add a child `server` tag with an `id`, replacing USERNAME with your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} username, and TOKEN with your {% data variables.product.pat_generic %}.

In the `repositories` tag, configure a repository by mapping the `id` of the repository to the `id` you added in the `server` tag containing your credentials. Replace {% ifversion ghes or ghae %}HOSTNAME with the host name of {% data variables.location.product_location %}, and{% endif %} OWNER with the name of the personal account or organization that owns the repository. Because uppercase letters aren't supported, you must use lowercase letters for the repository owner even if the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} user or organization name contains uppercase letters.

If you want to interact with multiple repositories, you can add each repository to separate `repository` children in the `repositories` tag, mapping the `id` of each to the credentials in the `servers` tag.

```

{% endif %}

## Publishing a package

{% data reusables.package_registry.default-name %} For example, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will publish a package named `com.example:test` in a repository called `OWNER/test`.

If you would like to publish multiple packages to the same repository, you can include the URL of the repository in the `<distributionManagement>` element of the _pom.xml_ file. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will match the repository based on that field. Since the repository name is also part of the `distributionManagement` element, there are no additional steps to publish multiple packages to the same repository.

For more information on creating a package, see the [maven.apache.org documentation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html).

1. Edit the `distributionManagement` element of the _pom.xml_ file located in your package directory, replacing {% ifversion ghes or ghae %}HOSTNAME with the host name of {% data variables.location.product_location %}, {% endif %}`OWNER` with the name of the personal account or organization that owns the repository and `REPOSITORY` with the name of the repository containing your project.{% ifversion ghes %}

   If your instance has subdomain isolation enabled:{% endif %}

   ```xml
   <distributionManagement>
      <repository>
        <id>github</id>
        <name>GitHub OWNER Apache Maven Packages</name>
        <url>https://{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}maven.pkg.github.com{% else %}maven.HOSTNAME{% endif %}/OWNER/REPOSITORY</url>
      </repository>
   </distributionManagement>
   ```{% ifversion ghes %}
   If your instance has subdomain isolation disabled:
   ```xml
   <distributionManagement>
      <repository>
        <id>github</id>
        <name>GitHub OWNER Apache Maven Packages</name>
        <url>https://HOSTNAME/_registry/maven/OWNER/REPOSITORY</url>
      </repository>
   </distributionManagement>
   ```{% endif %}

{% data reusables.package_registry.checksum-maven-plugin %}
1. Publish the package.

   ```shell
   mvn deploy
   ```

{% data reusables.package_registry.viewing-packages %}

## Installing a package

To install an Apache Maven package from {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}, edit the _pom.xml_ file to include the package as a dependency. If you want to install packages from any repository for a specified repository owner, use a repository URL like `https://{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}maven.pkg.github.com{% else %}maven.HOSTNAME{% endif %}/OWNER/*`. For more information on using a _pom.xml_ file in your project, see "[Introduction to the POM](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html)" in the Apache Maven documentation.

{% data reusables.package_registry.authenticate-step %}
1. Add the package dependencies to the `dependencies` element of your project _pom.xml_ file, replacing `com.example:test` with your package.

   ```xml
   <dependencies>
    <dependency>
       <groupId>com.example</groupId>
       <artifactId>test</artifactId>
       <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
     </dependency>
   </dependencies>
   ```

{% data reusables.package_registry.checksum-maven-plugin %}
1. Install the package.

   ```shell
   mvn install
   ```
