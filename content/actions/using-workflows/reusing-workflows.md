## Overview

Rather than copying and pasting from one workflow to another, you can make workflows reusable. You and anyone with access to the reusable workflow can then call the reusable workflow from another workflow.

Reusing workflows avoids duplication. This makes workflows easier to maintain and allows you to create new workflows more quickly by building on the work of others, just as you do with actions. Workflow reuse also promotes best practice by helping you to use workflows that are well designed, have already been tested, and have been proven to be effective. Your organization can build up a library of reusable workflows that can be centrally maintained.

The diagram below shows an in-progress workflow run that uses a reusable workflow.

* After each of three build jobs on the left of the diagram completes successfully, a dependent job called "Deploy" is run.
* The "Deploy" job calls a reusable workflow that contains three jobs: "Staging", "Review", and "Production."
* The "Production" deployment job only runs after the "Staging" job has completed successfully.
* When a job targets an environment, the workflow run displays a progress bar that shows the number of steps in the job. In the diagram below, the "Production" job contains 8 steps, with step 6 currently being processed.
* Using a reusable workflow to run deployment jobs allows you to run those jobs for each build without duplicating code in workflows.

![Diagram of a reusable workflow for deployment](/assets/images/help/images/reusable-workflows-ci-cd.png)

A workflow that uses another workflow is referred to as a "caller" workflow. The reusable workflow is a "called" workflow. One caller workflow can use multiple called workflows. Each called workflow is referenced in a single line. The result is that the caller workflow file may contain just a few lines of YAML, but may perform a large number of tasks when it's run. When you reuse a workflow, the entire called workflow is used, just as if it was part of the caller workflow.

If you reuse a workflow from a different repository, any actions in the called workflow run as if they were part of the caller workflow. For example, if the called workflow uses `actions/checkout`, the action checks out the contents of the repository that hosts the caller workflow, not the called workflow.

When a reusable workflow is triggered by a caller workflow, the `github` context is always associated with the caller workflow. The called workflow is automatically granted access to `github.token` and `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`. For more information about the `github` context, see "[Context and expression syntax for GitHub Actions](/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#github-context)."

You can view the reused workflows referenced in your {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows as dependencies in the dependency graph of the repository containing your workflows. For more information, see “[About the dependency graph](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph).”

### Reusable workflows and starter workflows

Starter workflows allow everyone in your organization who has permission to create workflows to do so more quickly and easily. When people create a new workflow, they can choose a starter workflow and some or all of the work of writing the workflow will be done for them. Within a starter workflow, you can also reference reusable workflows to make it easy for people to benefit from reusing centrally managed workflow code. If you use a commit SHA when referencing the reusable workflow, you can ensure that everyone who reuses that workflow will always be using the same YAML code. However, if you reference a reusable workflow by a tag or branch, be sure that you can trust that version of the workflow. For more information, see "[Security hardening for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#reusing-third-party-workflows)."

For more information, see "[Creating starter workflows for your organization](/actions/learn-github-actions/creating-starter-workflows-for-your-organization)."

## Access to reusable workflows

A reusable workflow can be used by another workflow if {% ifversion ghes or ghec or ghae %}any{% else %}either{% endif %} of the following is true:

* Both workflows are in the same repository.
* The called workflow is stored in a public repository{% ifversion actions-workflow-policy %}, and your {% ifversion ghec %}enterprise{% else %}organization{% endif %} allows you to use public reusable workflows{% endif %}.{% ifversion ghes or ghec or ghae %}
* The called workflow is stored in an internal repository and the settings for that repository allow it to be accessed. For more information, see {% ifversion internal-actions %}"[Sharing actions and workflows with your enterprise](/actions/creating-actions/sharing-actions-and-workflows-with-your-enterprise){% else %}"[Managing {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} settings for a repository](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#allowing-access-to-components-in-an-internal-repository){% endif %}."{% endif %}

## Using runners

{% ifversion fpt or ghes or ghec %}

### Using GitHub-hosted runners

The assignment of {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners is always evaluated using only the caller's context. Billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners is always associated with the caller. The caller workflow cannot use {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners from the called repository. For more information, see "[About {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners](/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners)."

### Using self-hosted runners

{% endif %}

Called workflows that are owned by the same user or organization{% ifversion ghes or ghec or ghae %} or enterprise{% endif %} as the caller workflow can access self-hosted runners from the caller's context. This means that a called workflow can access self-hosted runners that are:
* In the caller repository
* In the caller repository's organization{% ifversion ghes or ghec or ghae %} or enterprise{% endif %}, provided that the runner has been made available to the caller repository

## Limitations

{% ifversion nested-reusable-workflow %}
* You can connect up to four levels of workflows. For more information, see "[Nesting reusable workflows](#nesting-reusable-workflows)."
{% else %}
* Reusable workflows can't call other reusable workflows.
{% endif %}
* Reusable workflows stored within a private repository can only be used by workflows within the same repository.
* Any environment variables set in an `env` context defined at the workflow level in the caller workflow are not propagated to the called workflow. For more information about the `env` context, see "[Context and expression syntax for GitHub Actions](/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#env-context)."{% ifversion actions-reusable-workflow-matrix %}{% else %}
* The `strategy` property is not supported in any job that calls a reusable workflow.{% endif %}

## Creating a reusable workflow

Reusable workflows are YAML-formatted files, very similar to any other workflow file. As with other workflow files, you locate reusable workflows in the `.github/workflows` directory of a repository. Subdirectories of the `workflows` directory are not supported.

For a workflow to be reusable, the values for `on` must include `workflow_call`:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_call:
```

### Using inputs and secrets in a reusable workflow

You can define inputs and secrets, which can be passed from the caller workflow and then used within the called workflow. There are three stages to using an input or a secret in a reusable workflow.

1. In the reusable workflow, use the `inputs` and `secrets` keywords to define inputs or secrets that will be passed from a caller workflow.
   {% raw %}
   ```yaml
   on:
     workflow_call:
       inputs:
         config-path:
           required: true
           type: string
       secrets:
         envPAT:
           required: true
   ```
   {% endraw %}
   For details of the syntax for defining inputs and secrets, see [`on.workflow_call.inputs`](/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onworkflow_callinputs) and [`on.workflow_call.secrets`](/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onworkflow_callsecrets).
   {% ifversion actions-inherit-secrets-reusable-workflows %}
1. In the reusable workflow, reference the input or secret that you defined in the `on` key in the previous step.

   {% note %}

   **Note**: If the secrets are inherited by using `secrets: inherit` in the calling workflow, you can reference them even if they are not explicitly defined in the `on` key. For more information, see "[Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsecretsinherit)."

   {% endnote %}
   {%- else %}
1. In the reusable workflow, reference the input or secret that you defined in the `on` key in the previous step.
   {%- endif %}

   {% raw %}
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     reusable_workflow_job:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       environment: production
       steps:
       - uses: actions/labeler@v4
         with:
           repo-token: ${{ secrets.envPAT }}
           configuration-path: ${{ inputs.config-path }}
   ```
   {% endraw %}
   In the example above, `envPAT` is an environment secret that's been added to the `production` environment. This environment is therefore referenced within the job.

   {% note %}

   **Note**: Environment secrets are encrypted strings that are stored in an environment that you've defined for a repository. Environment secrets are only available to workflow jobs that reference the appropriate environment. For more information, see "[Using environments for deployment](/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#environment-secrets)."

   {% endnote %}

1. Pass the input or secret from the caller workflow.

{% indented_data_reference reusables.actions.pass-inputs-to-reusable-workflows spaces=3 %}

### Example reusable workflow

This reusable workflow file named `workflow-B.yml` (we'll refer to this later in the [example caller workflow](#example-caller-workflow)) takes an input string and a secret from the caller workflow and uses them in an action.

{% raw %}
```yaml{:copy}
name: Reusable workflow example

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      config-path:
        required: true
        type: string
    secrets:
      token:
        required: true

jobs:
  triage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/labeler@v4
      with:
        repo-token: ${{ secrets.token }}
        configuration-path: ${{ inputs.config-path }}
```
{% endraw %}

## Calling a reusable workflow

You call a reusable workflow by using the `uses` keyword. Unlike when you are using actions within a workflow, you call reusable workflows directly within a job, and not from within job steps.

[`jobs.<job_id>.uses`](/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_iduses)

You reference reusable workflow files using {% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.4 or ghae > 3.4 %}one of the following syntaxes:{% else %}the syntax:{% endif %}

{% data reusables.actions.reusable-workflow-calling-syntax %}

You can call multiple workflows, referencing each in a separate job.

{% data reusables.actions.uses-keyword-example %}

### Passing inputs and secrets to a reusable workflow

{% data reusables.actions.pass-inputs-to-reusable-workflows%}

{% ifversion actions-reusable-workflow-matrix %}
### Using a matrix strategy with a reusable workflow

Jobs using the matrix strategy can call a reusable workflow.

A matrix strategy lets you use variables in a single job definition to automatically create multiple job runs that are based on the combinations of the variables. For example, you can use a matrix strategy to pass different inputs to a reusable workflow. For more information about matrices, see "[Using a matrix for your jobs](/actions/using-jobs/using-a-matrix-for-your-jobs)."

This example job below calls a reusable workflow and references the matrix context by defining the variable `target` with the values `[dev, stage, prod]`. It will run three jobs, one for each value in the variable.

{% raw %}
```yaml{:copy}
jobs:
  ReuseableMatrixJobForDeployment:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        target: [dev, stage, prod]
    uses: octocat/octo-repo/.github/workflows/deployment.yml@main
    with:
      target: ${{ matrix.target }}
```
{% endraw %}
{% endif %}

### Supported keywords for jobs that call a reusable workflow

When you call a reusable workflow, you can only use the following keywords in the job containing the call:

* [`jobs.<job_id>.name`](/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idname)
* [`jobs.<job_id>.uses`](/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_iduses)
* [`jobs.<job_id>.with`](/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idwith)
* [`jobs.<job_id>.with.<input_id>`](/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idwithinput_id)
* [`jobs.<job_id>.secrets`](/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsecrets)
* [`jobs.<job_id>.secrets.<secret_id>`](/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsecretssecret_id)
{%- ifversion actions-inherit-secrets-reusable-workflows %}
* [`jobs.<job_id>.secrets.inherit`](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsecretsinherit)
{%- endif %}
{%- ifversion actions-reusable-workflow-matrix %}
* [`jobs.<job_id>.strategy`](/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategy)
{%- endif %}

   **Note:**

   * The `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions passed from the caller workflow can be only downgraded (not elevated) by the called workflow.

### Example caller workflow

This workflow file calls two workflow files. The second of these, `workflow-B.yml` (shown in the [example reusable workflow](#example-reusable-workflow)), is passed an input (`config-path`) and a secret (`token`).

{% raw %}
```yaml{:copy}
name: Call a reusable workflow

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  call-workflow:
    uses: octo-org/example-repo/.github/workflows/workflow-A.yml@v1

  call-workflow-passing-data:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    uses: octo-org/example-repo/.github/workflows/workflow-B.yml@main
    with:
      config-path: .github/labeler.yml
    secrets:
      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
{% endraw %}

{% ifversion nested-reusable-workflow %}
## Nesting reusable workflows

You can connect a maximum of four levels of workflows - that is, the top-level caller workflow and up to three levels of reusable workflows. For example: _caller-workflow.yml_ → _called-workflow-1.yml_ → _called-workflow-2.yml_ → _called-workflow-3.yml_. Loops in the workflow tree are not permitted.

From within a reusable workflow you can call another reusable workflow.

{% raw %}
```yaml{:copy}
name: Reusable workflow

on:
  workflow_call:

jobs:
  call-another-reusable:
    uses: octo-org/example-repo/.github/workflows/another-reusable.yml@v1
```
{% endraw %}

### Passing secrets to nested workflows

You can use `jobs.<job_id>.secrets` in a calling workflow to pass named secrets to a directly called workflow. Alternatively, you can use `jobs.<job_id>.secrets.inherit` to pass all of the calling workflow's secrets to a directly called workflow. For more information, see the section "[Passing inputs and secrets to a reusable workflow](/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#passing-inputs-and-secrets-to-a-reusable-workflow)" above, and the reference article "[Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsecretsinherit)." Secrets are only passed to directly called workflow, so in the workflow chain A > B > C, workflow C will only receive secrets from A if they have been passed from A to B, and then from B to C.

In the following example, workflow A passes all of its secrets to workflow B, by using the `inherit` keyword, but workflow B only passes one secret to workflow C. Any of the other secrets passed to workflow B are not available to workflow C.

{% raw %}
```yaml
jobs:
  workflowA-calls-workflowB:
    uses: octo-org/example-repo/.github/workflows/B.yml@main
    secrets: inherit # pass all secrets
```

```yaml
jobs:
  workflowB-calls-workflowC:
    uses: different-org/example-repo/.github/workflows/C.yml@main
    secrets:
      envPAT: ${{ secrets.envPAT }} # pass just this secret
```
{% endraw %}

### Access and permissions

A workflow that contains nested reusable workflows will fail if any of the nested workflows is inaccessible to the initial caller workflow. For more information, see "[Access to reusable workflows](/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#access-to-reusable-workflows)."

`GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions can only be the same or more restrictive in nested workflows. For example, in the workflow chain A > B > C, if workflow A has `package: read` token permission, then B and C cannot have `package: write` permission. For more information, see "[Automatic token authentication](/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication)."

For information on how to use the API to determine which workflow files were involved in a particular workflow run, see "[Monitoring which workflows are being used](#monitoring-which-workflows-are-being-used)."
{% endif %}

## Using outputs from a reusable workflow

A reusable workflow may generate data that you want to use in the caller workflow. To use these outputs, you must specify them as the outputs of the reusable workflow.{% ifversion actions-reusable-workflow-matrix %}

If a reusable workflow that sets an output is executed with a matrix strategy, the output will be the output set by the last successful completing reusable workflow of the matrix which actually sets a value.
That means if the last successful completing reusable workflow sets an empty string for its output, and the second last successful completing reusable workflow sets an actual value for its output, the output will contain the value of the second last completing reusable workflow.{% endif %}

The following reusable workflow has a single job containing two steps. In each of these steps we set a single word as the output: "hello" and "world." In the `outputs` section of the job, we map these step outputs to job outputs called: `output1` and `output2`. In the `on.workflow_call.outputs` section we then define two outputs for the workflow itself, one called `firstword` which we map to `output1`, and one called `secondword` which we map to `output2`.

{% raw %}
```yaml{:copy}
name: Reusable workflow

on:
  workflow_call:
    # Map the workflow outputs to job outputs
    outputs:
      firstword:
        description: "The first output string"
        value: ${{ jobs.example_job.outputs.output1 }}
      secondword:
        description: "The second output string"
        value: ${{ jobs.example_job.outputs.output2 }}

jobs:
  example_job:
    name: Generate output
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Map the job outputs to step outputs
    outputs:
      output1: ${{ steps.step1.outputs.firstword }}
      output2: ${{ steps.step2.outputs.secondword }}
    steps:
      - id: step1{% endraw %}
{%- ifversion actions-save-state-set-output-envs %}
        run: echo "firstword=hello" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
{%- else %}
        run: echo "::set-output name=firstword::hello"
{%- endif %}{% raw %}
      - id: step2{% endraw %}
{%- ifversion actions-save-state-set-output-envs %}
        run: echo "secondword=world" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
{%- else %}
        run: echo "::set-output name=secondword::world"
{%- endif %}{% raw %}
```
{% endraw %}

We can now use the outputs in the caller workflow, in the same way you would use the outputs from a job within the same workflow. We reference the outputs using the names defined at the workflow level in the reusable workflow: `firstword` and `secondword`. In this workflow, `job1` calls the reusable workflow and `job2` prints the outputs from the reusable workflow ("hello world") to standard output in the workflow log.

{% raw %}
```yaml{:copy}
name: Call a reusable workflow and use its outputs

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  job1:
    uses: octo-org/example-repo/.github/workflows/called-workflow.yml@v1

  job2:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: job1
    steps:
      - run: echo ${{ needs.job1.outputs.firstword }} ${{ needs.job1.outputs.secondword }}
```
{% endraw %}

For more information on using job outputs, see "[Workflow syntax for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idoutputs)."

## Monitoring which workflows are being used

You can use the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} REST API to monitor how reusable workflows are being used. The `prepared_workflow_job` audit log action is triggered when a workflow job is started. Included in the data recorded are:
* `repo` - the organization/repository where the workflow job is located. For a job that calls another workflow, this is the organization/repository of the caller workflow.
* `@timestamp` - the date and time that the job was started, in Unix epoch format.
* `job_name` - the name of the job that was run.
{% ifversion nested-reusable-workflow %}
* `calling_workflow_refs` - an array of file paths for all the caller workflows involved in this workflow job. The items in the array are in the reverse order that they were called in. For example, in a chain of workflows A > B > C, when viewing the logs for a job in workflow C, the array would be `["octo-org/octo-repo/.github/workflows/B.yml", "octo-org/octo-repo/.github/workflows/A.yml"]`.
* `calling_workflow_shas` - an array of SHAs for all the caller workflows involved in this workflow job. The array contains the same number of items, in the same order, as the `calling_workflow_refs` array. {% endif %}
* `job_workflow_ref` - the workflow file that was used, in the form `{owner}/{repo}/{path}/{filename}@{ref}`. For a job that calls another workflow, this identifies the called workflow.

For information about using the REST API to query the audit log for an organization, see "[Organizations](/rest/reference/orgs#get-the-audit-log-for-an-organization)."

{% note %}

**Note**: Audit data for `prepared_workflow_job` can only be viewed using the REST API. It is not visible in the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} web interface, or included in JSON/CSV exported audit data.
