## Overview

OpenID Connect (OIDC) allows your {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows to authenticate with [Octpopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/) to push packages, create releases or trigger deployments without storing Octopus Deploy passwords or API keys as long-lived {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} secrets.

This guide provides an overview of how to configure Octopus Deploy to trust {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s OIDC as a federated identity, and includes a workflow example for the [`octopusdeploy/login`](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/login) action that uses tokens to authenticate to your Octopus Deploy instance.

## Adding the identity provider to Octopus Deploy

To use OIDC with Octopus Deploy, first establish a trust relationship between {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} and your Octopus Deploy instance. For more information about this process, see [Using OpenID Connect with the Octopus API](https://octopus.com/docs/octopus-rest-api/openid-connect) in the Octopus Deploy documentation.

1. Sign in to your Octopus Deploy instance.
1. Create or open the Service Account that will be granted access via the token request.
1. Configure a new OIDC Identity, defining the relevant subject that the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow token request will be validated against.

## Updating your {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow

To update your workflows for OIDC, you will need to make two changes to your YAML:
1. Add permissions settings for the token.
1. Use the [`OctopusDeploy/login`](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/login) action to exchange the OIDC token (JWT) for a cloud access token.

### Adding permissions settings

{% data reusables.actions.oidc-permissions-token %}

### Requesting the access token

The [`octopus/login`](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/login) action receives a JWT from the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} OIDC provider, and then requests an access token from your Octopus Server instance. For more information, see the [`octopus/login`](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/login) documentation.

The following example exchanges an OIDC ID token with your Octopus Deploy instance to receive an access token, which can then be used to access your Octopus Deploy resources. Be sure to replace the `server` and `service_account_id` details appropriately for your scenario.
