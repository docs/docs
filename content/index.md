We've recently moved some of the REST API documentation. If you can't find what you're looking for, you might try the new Branches, Collaborators, Commits, Deploy Keys, Deployments, GitHub Pages, Releases, Metrics, Webhooks REST API pages.

Webhooks
The webhooks API allows you to create and manage webhooks for your repositories.
Repository webhooks allow you to receive HTTP POST payloads whenever certain events happen in a repository. The webhook REST APIs enable you to manage repository, organization, and app webhooks. You can use this API to list webhook deliveries for a webhook, or get and redeliver an individual delivery for a webhook, which can be integrated into an external app or service. You can also use the REST API to change the configuration of the webhook. For example, you can modify the payload URL, content type, SSL verification, and secret. For more information, see:

Repository Webhooks REST API
Organization Webhooks REST API
GitHub App Webhooks REST API
If you would like to set up a single webhook to receive events from all of your organization's repositories, see our API documentation for Organization Webhooks.

In addition to the REST API, GitHub can also serve as a PubSubHubbub hub for repositories.

Receiving Webhooks
In order for GitHub to send webhook payloads, your server needs to be accessible from the Internet. We also highly suggest using SSL so that we can send encrypted payloads over HTTPS.

Webhook headers
GitHub will send along several HTTP headers to differentiate between event types and payload identifiers. See webhook headers for details.

PubSubHubbub
GitHub can also serve as a PubSubHubbub hub for all repositories. PSHB is a simple publish/subscribe protocol that lets servers register to receive updates when a topic is updated. The updates are sent with an HTTP POST request to a callback URL. Topic URLs for a GitHub repository's pushes are in this format:

https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/events/{event}

The event can be any available webhook event. For more information, see "Webhook events and payloads."

Response format
The default format is what existing post-receive hooks should expect: A JSON body sent as the payload parameter in a POST. You can also specify to receive the raw JSON body with either an Accept header, or a .json extension.

Accept: application/json
https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/events/push.json
Callback URLs
Callback URLs can use the http:// protocol.

# Send updates to postbin.org
http://postbin.org/123
Subscribing
The GitHub PubSubHubbub endpoint is: https://api.github.com/hub. A successful request with curl looks like:

curl -u "user" -i \
  https://api.github.com/hub \
  -F "hub.mode=subscribe" \
  -F "hub.topic=https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/events/push" \
  -F "hub.callback=http://postbin.org/123"
PubSubHubbub requests can be sent multiple times. If the hook already exists, it will be modified according to the request.

Parameters
Name	Type	Description
hub.mode	string	Required. Either subscribe or unsubscribe.
hub.topic	string	Required. The URI of the GitHub repository to subscribe to. The path must be in the format of /{owner}/{repo}/events/{event}.
hub.callback	string	The URI to receive the updates to the topic.
hub.secret	string	A shared secret key that generates a hash signature of the outgoing body content. You can verify a push came from GitHub by comparing the raw request body with the contents of the X-Hub-Signature or X-Hub-Signature-256 headers. You can see the PubSubHubbub documentation for more details.
