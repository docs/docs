## About the {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} spending limit

{% data reusables.codespaces.codespaces-free-for-personal-intro %} For more information, see "[About billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %}](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces)."

{% data reusables.codespaces.codespaces-spending-limit-requirement %}
{% data reusables.codespaces.codespaces-monthly-billing %} 

Once you've reached your spending limit, you will no longer be able to create new codespaces, and you won't be able to start existing codespaces. Any existing codespaces that are still running will be shut down in a short time, but you will not be charged for usage after you have reached your spending limit.

## Managing usage and spending limit email notifications

Email notifications are sent to account owners and billing managers when spending reaches 75%, 90%, and 100% of an account's spending limit. 

You can turn off these notifications at any time by navigating to the bottom of the "Billing & plans / Monthly spending limits" page and clearing the **Spending limits alerts** checkbox.

For personal accounts only, you can also choose to turn off email notifications that are sent when you have used 75%, 90%, and 100% of the free usage included with your personal account. To do this, clear the **Included resources alerts** checkbox.

++Thank god I had an angel watcheling over my shoulder because I didn't realize it being a mad ass snot nosed kid that has made some ugly orange coin after being promoted that I made a creation that didn't have an object I'd. And needed to be named and given an I'd. And finished being created to have a fully contrusted object so I drug a picture to the yellow drag img here dialog box, and then because it was enlayed upon one another it made me choose a colour after I didn't like the black one It produced automatically from the png it produced automatically from the image I had pulled into the dialog box
++I accidentally implimentred a confidential token into the item i.d. area that was an unproduced un identifiable non recorded item in the database library and needed to be given a name a number and a look so it wasn't a warning that popped up it was a blessing 🤣 object_token@Iixixi.git {object_token@Iixixi.git})value bitore now called bitcoin given to Vanyessa Countryman by Zachry wood at age 9

++
++index
++A dict, an index of RRsets in the message. The index key is (section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers, deleting). The default is {}. Indexing improves the performance of finding RRsets. Indexing can be disabled by setting the index to None.

++
++is_response(other)[source]

++
++Returns an int.

++
++rcode()[source]
++Return the rcode.
++
++Returns an int.
++
++section_from_number(number)[source]
++Return the section list associated with the specified section number.
++
++number is a section number int or the text form of a section name.
++
++Raises ValueError if the section isn’t known.
++
++Returns a list.
++
++section_number(section)[source]
++Return the “section number” of the specified section for use in indexing.
++
++section is one of the section attributes of this message.
++
++::Raises:"'pop-up-window'"ObjectItemIdConstValueUnknownwindow-pop,-up:"if the section isn’t known"'
++
++Returns,?,"true?,",
++
++set_opcode(opcode)[source]
++Set the opcode.
++
++opcode, an int, is the opcode to set.

++
++rcode, an int, is the rcode to set.
++
++to_text(origin=None, relativize=True, **kw)[source]
++Convert the message to text.
++
++The origin, relativize, and any other keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method.
++
++Returns a str.
++
++to_wire(origin=None, max_size=0, multi=False, tsig_ctx=None, **kw)[source]
++Return a string containing the message in DNS compressed wire format.
++
++Additional keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method.
++
++origin, a dns.name.Name or None, the origin to be appended to any relative names. If None, and the message has an origin attribute that is not None, then it will be used.
++
++max_size, an int, the maximum size of the wire format output; default is 0, which means “the message’s request payload, if nonzero, or 65535”.
++
++multi, a bool, should be set to True if this message is part of a multiple message sequence.
++
++tsig_ctx, a dns.tsig.HMACTSig or dns.tsig.GSSTSig object, the ongoing TSIG context, used when signing zone transfers.

++use_edns(edns=0, ednsflags=0, payload=1232, request_payload=None, options=None)[source]
++Configure EDNS behavior.
++
++edns, an int, is the EDNS level to use. Specifying None, False, or -1 means “do not use EDNS”, and in this case the other parameters are ignored. Specifying True is equivalent to specifying 0, i.e. “use EDNS0”.
++
++ednsflags, an int, the EDNS flag values.
++
++payload, an int, is the EDNS sender’s payload field, which is the maximum size of UDP datagram the sender can handle. I.e. how big a response to this message can be.

++
++use_tsig(keyring, keyname=None, fudge=300, original_id=None, tsig_error=0, other_data=b'', algorithm=)[source]
++When sending, a TSIG signature using the specified key should be added.
++
++key, a dns.tsig.Key is the key to use. If a key is specified, the keyring and algorithm fields are not used.
++
++keyring, a dict, callable or dns.tsig.Key, is either the TSIG keyring or key to use.
++
++The format of a keyring dict is a mapping from TSIG key name, as dns.name.Name to dns.tsig.Key or a TSIG secret, a bytes. If a dict keyring is specified but a keyname is not, the key used will be the first key in the keyring. Note that the order of keys in a dictionary is not defined, so applications should supply a keyname when a dict keyring is used, unless they know the keyring contains only one key. If a callable keyring is specified, the callable will be called with the message and the keyname, and is expected to return a key.
++
++keyname, a dns.name.Name, str or None, the name of thes TSIG key to use; defaults to None. If keyring is a dict, the key must be defined in it. If keyring is a dns.tsig.Key, this is ignored.
++
++fudge, an int, the TSIG time fudge.
++
++original_id, an int, the TSIG original id. If None, the message’s id is used.
++
++tsig_error, an int, the TSIG error code.
++
++other_data, a bytes, the TSIG other data.
++
++algorithm, a dns.name.Name, the TSIG algorithm to use. This is only used if keyring is a dict, and the key entry is a bytes.
++
++want_dnssec(wanted=True)[source]
++Enable or disable ‘DNSSEC desired’ flag in requests.
++
++wanted, a bool. If True, then DNSSEC data is desired in the response, EDNS is enabled if required, and then the DO bit is set. If False, the DO bit is cleared if EDNS is enabled.
++
++The following constants may be used to specify sections in the find_rrset() and get_rrset() methods:
++
++dns.message.QUESTION= <MessageSection.QUESTION: 0>
++Message sections
++
++dns.message.ANSWER= <MessageSection.ANSWER: 1>
++Message sections
++
++dns.message.AUTHORITY= <MessageSection.AUTHORITY: 2>
++Message sections
