## About internal repositories

{% data reusables.repositories.about-internal-repos %} For more information on innersource, see {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s whitepaper "[An introduction to innersource](https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/introduction-to-innersource/)."

{% ifversion ghec %}
{% note %}

**Note:** You can only create internal repositories if you use {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} with an enterprise account. An enterprise account is a separate type of account that allows a central point of management for multiple organizations. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts)."

{% endnote %}
{% endif %}

All enterprise members have read permissions to the internal repository, but internal repositories are not visible to people {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}outside of the enterprise{% else %}who are not members of any organization{% endif %}, including outside collaborators on organization repositories. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/roles-in-an-enterprise#enterprise-members)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization)."

{% ifversion ghes %}
{% note %}

**Note:** A user must be part of an organization to be an enterprise member and have access to internal repositories. If a user on {% data variables.location.product_location %} is not a member of any organization, that user will not have access to internal repositories.

{% endnote %}
{% endif %}

{% data reusables.repositories.internal-repo-default %}

{% ifversion ghec %}Unless your enterprise uses {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, members{% else %}Members{% endif %} of the enterprise can fork any internal repository owned by an organization in the enterprise. The forked repository will belong to the member's personal account, and the visibility of the fork will be private. If a user is removed from all organizations owned by the enterprise, that user's forks of internal repositories are removed automatically.

{% ifversion ghec %}
{% note %}

**Note:** {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_managed_users_caps %} cannot fork internal repositories. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/about-enterprise-managed-users#abilities-and-restrictions-of-managed-user-accounts)."
