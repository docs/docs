## About the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %}

{% data reusables.package_registry.container-registry-benefits %} For more information, see "[Working with the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %}](/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry)."

## About migration from the Docker registry

{% data reusables.package_registry.container-registry-replaces-docker-registry %} If you've stored Docker images in the Docker registry, {% ifversion docker-ghcr-enterprise-migration %}an enterprise owner{% else %}{% data variables.product.company_short %}{% endif %} will gradually migrate the images to the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %}. No action is required on your part.

{% ifversion docker-ghcr-enterprise-migration %}

{% note %}

**Note**: {% data reusables.package_registry.container-registry-ghes-migration-availability %} For more information about finding the version of {% data variables.product.product_name %} that you use, see "[About versions of {% data variables.product.prodname_docs %}](/get-started/learning-about-github/about-versions-of-github-docs#github-enterprise-server)."

{% endnote %}

{% endif %}

After a Docker image has been migrated to the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %}, you'll see the following changes to the details for the package.

- The icon will be the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %} logo instead of the Docker logo.
- The domain in the pull URL will be {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry_namespace %} instead of {% data variables.product.prodname_docker_registry_namespace %}.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

{% endif %}

{% data reusables.package_registry.container-registry-migration-namespaces %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

After migration, you'll no longer be able to use the GraphQL API to query for packages with a `PackageType` of "DOCKER". Instead, you can use the REST API to query for packages with a `package_type` of "container". For more information, see "[Packages](/rest/reference/packages)" in the REST API documentation.

## About billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %}

For more information about billing for the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %}, see "[About billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-packages/about-billing-for-github-packages)."
